// Which agent CLI the pane-setup card is currently describing (#1020 item 4).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The setup card asks the human to pick what a pane becomes, and until
// they hit Create the only statement of that choice is a `<select>` they have to read. The
// human's demo note was "a preview icon of the CLI agent, for quick identification" — i.e.
// the card should SHOW the answer the way a pane header already does, rather than spelling
// it in a dropdown.
//
// The mark itself is NOT this module's business: `agentMark`/`agentMarkFor`
// (src/agenticons.ts, #992) already own "program name → glyph, letter badge, or the neutral
// tier", including the licensing tiering, the injection clamp and the refusal to guess.
// This module owns the ONE question that surface has and the pane header does not: a pane
// header knows what it launched, and a setup card knows only what is half-filled in. So
// what lives here is the mapping from a form mid-edit to the program (if any) it currently
// names — and, just as often, to `null`, because most of the card's states name no agent at
// all and a badge that appeared anyway would be asserting one.
//
// DOM-free on purpose (test/setuppreview.test.ts imports it directly, no jsdom): the form
// hands over raw control values, and every "does this state name a CLI" rule is decided
// here where a test can reach it.

   *
   * **A resolved answer rather than a control, and that distinction is the fix** (#1020
   * rev-740 blocking 1 and 1b). This preview was wrong twice, both times because it read a
   * form control while the launch reads the resolved roster: first the group-default picker
   * when the pane launches on the per-role one, then the per-role select when the advanced
   * toggle makes `create_group_ex` discard the form's blocks for the declared file's
   * entirely. Every such fix names a control and produces the next twin. Taking the roster's
   * own answer ends the class — the two cannot disagree, because there is only one
   * resolution and the human is already reading its output in the roster box below.
   *
   * Hence `null` is a real state rather than a defensive `?`: a roster resolves
   * asynchronously (the backend reads the repo), and a badge drawn from the previous repo's
   * answer would be the same confident-wrong-answer one refresh later.

/**
 * The mark the setup card should draw right now, or `null` for "draw nothing".
 *
 * **`null` is the common answer and it is the load-bearing one.** #992's rule — inherited
 * wholesale here — is that a wrong badge is worse than no badge, because a badge is read as
 * an answer. A setup card spends most of its life in states that name no agent: a terminal,
 * a file explorer, an SSH login shell, a custom command box the human has not typed into
 * yet. Each of those gets nothing, never a `?` — the neutral tier means "loomux cannot tell
 * WHICH agent this is", and saying that about a pane that will run no agent at all is a
 * different, false claim.
 *
 * Per kind, and each rule exists because the one it replaces would lie:
 *
 *   * **content kinds and `terminal`** — nothing. They spawn no CLI at all (`isContentKind`,
 *     and a shell is a shell), so there is no program for a mark to name.
 *   * **`agent`, a built-in CLI** — that CLI's mark, by id. The ids in `AGENTS`
 *     (src/agents.ts) ARE the program names, which is what makes this a lookup rather than
 *     a second table to keep in step.
 *   * **`agent`, `custom…`, box empty** — nothing. The human has picked "I will type a
 *     command" and has not typed it; a neutral badge here would report a failure to
 *     identify something that has not been named yet.
 *   * **`agent`, `custom…`, box filled** — read the command, exactly as a pane does. Which
 *     means a path-qualified or `.exe`-suffixed first token resolves (`programFromRestore`,
 *     via `agentMark`), a shell or transport lands neutral, and gibberish lands neutral.
 *   * **`orchestrator`** — the CLI the RESOLVED ROSTER gives the orchestrator block, handed
 *     in already worked out (`orchestratorCliOf`); no form control is read. That roster is
 *     the form's per-role picks in the ordinary case and the declared workflow file's blocks
 *     when the advanced toggle is on, which is exactly the substitution the backend makes —
 *     so the badge cannot disagree with the pane, or with the roster box beneath it. Nothing
 *     resolved yet ⇒ nothing drawn. `custom…` is refused, never badged `C`.
 *   * **`ssh`, a remote CLI chosen** — that CLI, as the AUTHORITATIVE answer, which is what
 *     `knownCli` means: the launch line will be the local ssh client, so reading it would
 *     name the transport. `remote` rides along for the same reason it does on a live pane.
 *   * **`ssh`, "None — a plain login shell"** — nothing. Not the remote-unknown neutral
 *     badge: loomux is not failing to identify a far-end agent, it has been told there
 *     isn't one.
