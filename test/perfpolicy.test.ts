// The frontend half of #743's enforcement — **E2** in `doc/design/performance.md`.
//
// THE INVARIANTS. Two of the six in that note are properties of frontend code
// that no unit test of any single module can see:
//
//   INV-3 (§3) — every backend event stream the webview subscribes to is
//   bounded *before* the webview pays for it, because a Tauri emit is a
//   per-event JS compilation on the one thread that also services input and
//   paint (§1). A stream whose rate is set by an external producer is bounded
//   backend-side by P2 (coalesce per frame) or handler-side by P5 (rAF
//   dirty-flag) — §2.
//
//   INV-4 (§3) — every fixed-cadence timer declares itself: its real cadence,
//   and what it does when nobody is looking at the window.
//
// Both are properties of the SET of listeners and timers, not of any one of
// them, so the only honest way to pin them is to enumerate: scan `src/*.ts`
// for the two call shapes and require every hit to appear in a manifest that
// states its rate class and its bound. `src-tauri/tests/perf_dispatch.rs`
// (E1) is the same idea on the command surface — scan plus a test-side
// manifest — and the two are meant to read as one mechanism.
//
// WHY A MANIFEST AND NOT A LINT. The property is not "no unbounded streams
// exist" — several do today, enumerated in #743's census (plan parts 2b) and
// owned by later slices. The property is that **an unbounded one cannot be
// added silently**: a new `listen()` or `setInterval()` fails this test until
// somebody writes down what bounds it, and that sentence is a review-visible
// diff. The debt rows are the census made executable; deleting one is the
// roadmap, adding one has to argue itself.
//
// HOW TODAY'S GAPS ARE RECORDED. §3's vocabulary is
// `gated | component-scoped | argued(reason)` for timers and
// `backend-coalesced | rAF-gated | throttled | argued-none(reason)` for
// streams — there is no "unbounded" value, deliberately. A row that has no
// gate today says so in its `reason` and names the slice that owns closing it
// in `debt`, exactly as E1's `debt` class does for sync commands. So `argued`
// here means "argued in the reason field", which for a debt row is the
// argument that it is known, bounded in blast radius, and owned — not that it
// is fine. The test enforces the difference: a producer-rate stream may not
// declare `argued-none` without an owning issue (below).
//
// WHAT THIS IS NOT. A source scan cannot prove a declared bound actually
// bounds anything at runtime — it checks that the claim exists, is one of the
// legal shapes, and still points at real code (an `rAF-gated` row's cite must
// contain a `requestAnimationFrame`). The residue is carried by review, the
// same stated bound E1 accepts for call chains (§3). It reads every `.ts`
// under `src/` at any depth, but a listener registered from Rust-side
// generated code, or with an event name that is not a literal, is not
// something it can name — so it refuses to pass over one instead, by counting
// call sites and requiring the count to match what it extracted.
//
// The one shape it cannot see at all is a **self-rescheduling `setTimeout`** —
// a `tick()` that ends by scheduling itself is a fixed-cadence poll wearing a
// different call, and nothing here would ask it to declare a cadence. This
// test does not go looking for them (deciding which of `src/`'s ~30
// `setTimeout` uses are one-shots is a reading job, not a regex), so INV-4
// names `setInterval` on purpose and the reviewer rule is the residue: a new
// recurring poll is written as `setInterval` and declared here, or its shape
// is argued in the PR that introduces it.
