//! Crash observability (issue #53).
//!
//! Three cheap, dependency-free facilities so the *next* hard crash leaves
//! something to read:
//!
//! 1. A **panic hook** that appends a crash log (message + location + thread +
//!    backtrace) to `<data>/orrerix/logs/crash-<ts>.log`. It wraps — and still
//!    chains to — the default hook, and is written to never panic itself.
//!    It writes in **two phases** (#1219): the minimal record and the `panic`
//!    breadcrumb are composed without `core::fmt` and flushed *before* any
//!    backtrace work, so a death during symbolication — which aborts the
//!    process outright, with no unwind and no second hook call — still leaves
//!    the record it exists to leave. A thread-local latch diverts a re-entrant
//!    run to a single emergency line. See `write_crash_log_in`, `HookGuard`,
//!    and `docs/design/crash-observability.md`.
//! 2. A **breadcrumb log** (`breadcrumbs.log`, rotated once at ~2 MB) of
//!    timestamped one-liners for lifecycle events — pane/PTY open/close/resize,
//!    agent spawn/death, MCP request failures, delivery outcomes. It must never
//!    be handed prompt or output *content*: that lives in the audit log already,
//!    and breadcrumbs stay small and privacy-safe (event + ids only).
//! 3. A **running.lock sentinel**, written at startup and removed on a clean
//!    shutdown. Finding it at the next startup means the previous run died
//!    without unwinding to a clean exit; we surface a next-launch notice that
//!    names the newest crash log.
//!
//! None of that is desktop-specific, which is why the file lives here (#888
//! slice A3 batch 7). What *is* desktop-specific — the `StartupNotice` state
//! cell and the `take_startup_notice` command the webview drains it through —
//! stayed in `src-tauri/src/obs.rs`, which re-exports everything below so every
//! `crate::obs::…` call site over there still resolves.
//!
//! Rotation mirrors the orchestration audit log (`rotate_audit_if_needed`): one
//! kept generation, size-triggered, single-write `O_APPEND` lines. Breadcrumb
//! writes stay lock-free — unlike the audit log they carry no rotation/append
//! ordering contract, and a line that races a rollover lands in the rotated
//! generation rather than being lost. A crash that
//! aborts the process without unwinding (stack overflow, an FFI access
//! violation, `abort()`) never runs the hook — see `docs/design/crash-observability.md`.

// is a panic-while-panicking: std's `panic_count` returns `MustAbort::
// PanicInHook` and aborts on the spot, so the hook is never re-entered, no
// unwind starts, and `catch_unwind` never gets control. #1218 is that shape

// The panic hook above cannot see this class at all, and that is not a bug in
// it. When a global allocator returns null, `RawVec` calls
// `handle_alloc_error`, which calls `abort()` — it never enters
// `std::panicking`, so no hook of any kind runs. #1218's three production
// crashes were all exactly this: a `Vec<u8>` grow of 64 MiB and then 128 MiB
// refused on a machine pinned at its commit limit, `handle_alloc_error` →
// `__rust_alloc_error_handler` → `rust_oom` → `__fastfail(7)` → `0xc0000409`.
// A write-first panic hook would still have produced nothing for any of them.
//
// `rust_oom` calls `default_alloc_error_hook` on the way, which writes
// "memory allocation of N bytes failed" to stderr — so the abort is
// print-then-die, and a windowed build with no console is what discarded it
// (#1218 round 4). Our record is written strictly EARLIER in that sequence,
// here, and carries the alignment, timestamp and app version as well as the
// size. See `docs/design/crash-observability.md` for the full frame list and
// for the stderr-capture follow-up.
//
// `std::alloc::set_alloc_error_hook` is the matching seam and is nightly-only.
// The stable one is this: a `#[global_allocator]` that delegates every call to
// `System` and, on a null return, writes the record BEFORE handing the null
// back to `handle_alloc_error`. The host installs it — see
// `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` — because a `#[global_allocator]` may be declared only
// once per artifact and that is the artifact's decision, not the engine's.
//
// **The discipline this path is written under.** It runs inside
// `GlobalAlloc::alloc`, on the return path of a request that has just failed,
// so it may not allocate — an allocation here would re-enter the allocator in
// the one state where it cannot serve, and a large enough failure would recurse.
// Hence: the file is opened ONCE at startup and the handle kept
// (`ALLOC_LOG`); the record is composed into a stack `FixedBuf` through the same
// `Sink` composers the panic hook's first phase uses; and a thread-local latch
// makes a nested failure a no-op rather than a recursion. `write_all` and
// `flush` on an already-open `fs::File` allocate nothing.

/// Size of the stack buffer the allocation-failure record is composed into.
