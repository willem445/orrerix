/** What the group panel says when the roster declares a manager and none is

 *  which is nearly every group: most declare no manager at all.
 *
 *  **This is the whole human-facing answer to "the manager is not there", and
 *  it is deliberately a NOTICE rather than a repair.** Nothing in orrerix
 *  reopens a manager pane automatically, because it cannot tell the two reasons
 *  apart: `docs/features/manager.md` promises the human "if you close the
 *  manager pane, the group behaves as it always has", so closing it is a
 *  legitimate act — and a pane that crashed is indistinguishable from one the
 *  human deliberately closed. Auto-reopening would contradict a shipped promise
 *  on a guess. So the app states the fact and names the route back; the human
 *  decides. See `docs/design/manager.md`, "Why nothing reopens a dead manager".
 *
 *  It covers BOTH of #1433's cases with one surface, because from here they are
 *  the same fact: the launch-time open failed, or the pane died later. What the
 *  human needs in either case is to know the pane is not there and how to get
 *  it back — not which of the two happened, which the audit log records anyway.
 *
 *  `live` is a count and not a bool on purpose: it is `roles.manager` straight
 *  off the summary, and a group can never hold two live managers
 *  (`MANAGER_MAX` is 1, enforced at parse), so anything above zero is "the pane
 *  is there". */
