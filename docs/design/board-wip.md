# Design: board WIP limits (#1175)

Status: implemented (PR #1182). Config in `loomux-engine::workflow` (`BoardPolicy`,
`RawBoard`/`RawWip`), accounting and enforcement in `orchestration::mod`
(`wip_occupants`, `wip_counts`, `wip_breaches`, `wip_may_change`,
`OrchRegistry::upsert_task_from`), agent surface in
`orchestration::mcp` (`list_tasks`, `upsert_task`), chrome in `src/wipchips.ts` +
`src/tasksview.ts`.

## Problem

**Max live agents caps concurrent agents; nothing caps concurrent work.** An orchestrator
can hold four agents and still pile up ten items in `review` and `pr` while starting new
tasks — review debt, which the 2025 DORA report measures as the AI-era instability
signature (throughput up sharply, incidents per PR up far more). "Finish before you start"
was prose in the orchestrator template; kanban's answer is a per-column WIP limit, and it
is a mechanism.

The research that filed this is #1170 candidate A2, which also fixes the shape: repo
config in `.loomux/workflow.yml`, absent block = feature off, enforcement at the same
validation seam that refuses dependency cycles.

## Config

```yaml
board:
  wip:
    in-progress: 4
    review: 3
  enforce: false   # the default; omit it
```

An absent `board:` block means **no caps at all** and behaviour byte-for-byte unchanged —
the posture `resources:` and `merge_queue:` already take, including the documented
consequence that *adding* the key breaks the file for builds that predate it
(`RawWorkflow` is `deny_unknown_fields`, and a policy key an older build does not
understand means a human believes a policy is in force that is not).

### Why a closed struct, not `BTreeMap<String, u32>`

`RawWip` has one `Option<u32>` field per cappable status rather than an open map, and this
is the design's load-bearing small decision. An open key namespace **cannot tell a typo
from a status a newer loomux might have**: `in-porgress: 4` would parse, declare a limit on
nothing, and stay silent for the lifetime of the file. The closed struct hands that check
to `deny_unknown_fields`, whose error already names every field it would have accepted — so
the repo that misspells a status is told which spellings exist, at parse time, and this
module writes no check of its own.

The price is that the field list is a second copy of `TASK_STATUSES`, which lives in
`src-tauri` — on the other side of an arrow the engine crate may not point back along, so
it cannot be derived. It is pinned instead, in both directions:
`every_task_status_except_done_can_carry_a_cap` asserts the struct's serde field names are
exactly `TASK_STATUSES` minus `done`. A ninth status reddens rather than quietly arriving
uncappable.

Downstream, the parse produces a `BTreeMap<String, u32>` keyed by the wire status name. The
struct exists to *validate*; the map is the shape the rest of loomux reasons about, so the
accounting, the refusal text and the board chips are all status-generic.

### Why `done` cannot be capped

`done` is terminal and it is the **relief valve**: every other cap is relieved by work
reaching it. A limit there would refuse the very transition that unblocks the board — the
exact inversion of what a WIP limit is for — and under `enforce` it would wedge the board
rather than pace it. It has no field, so it is a parse error rather than a rule to
remember (`WIP_UNCAPPABLE_STATUS` is the one spelling the docs, the error path and the pin
all read).

`blocked` **is** cappable, deliberately: too much blocked work is a real signal and warn
mode is the right way to surface it. But an *enforced* cap on `blocked` refuses an agent's
report of reality, so the docs and the schema help text both recommend leaving it uncapped
under `enforce: true`. That is advice, not a rule — a repo that means it may write it.

### Why no grouped cap (`review+pr: 3`)

The issue floated grouping two statuses under one cap, which is where the practice
sometimes goes. Rejected, for three reasons:

1. **The board's display unit is the status.** #1105 gives the board kanban columns, and a
   column header showing `3/3` is the standard affordance. A cap spanning two columns has
   no honest column header: either two headers show the same number (which reads as two
   caps) or one shows it (which reads as a cap on one column).
2. **Two numbers say the same thing.** "At most 3 items downstream of coding" is
   `review: 2, pr: 1`. The grouped form buys the ability to trade one for the other; it
   costs the ability to say which stage is the bottleneck, which is the thing the human is
   actually looking at the board to learn.
3. **The config would have to grow a level** — `wip: { name: { statuses: [...], limit: N } }`
   — which loses the exact shape the issue itself wrote (`wip: { in-progress: 4 }`) and
   loses `deny_unknown_fields` as the status-name check along with it.

It is not foreclosed: an additive sibling key could express groups later without changing
what is here.

## Enforcement: one seam, judged on the board the write produces

The check sits in `upsert_task_from`, in the same run of validations that already refuses
dependency cycles, hierarchy cycles, the ladder and failed claim guards. Nothing is persisted
until `write_tasks`, so a refusal leaves the board exactly as it was — the contract every
other refusal there keeps.

**It judges the post-write board against the pre-write board, and that is a correction.**
The first cut judged an *entry*: the target status read off the patch, the container topology
read off the un-mutated board. That is CLAUDE.md's *"a guard reads every one of its inputs by
one rule"* violated exactly — one signal from the patch, the next from the state it is about
to replace — and it failed in both directions (rev-1 B1):

- A combined `parent` + `status` write, **the shape `upsert_task`'s own tool description
  recommends**, was refused for a count that included the very row the write turns into a
  container.
- Clearing a `parent` while entering a status silently exceeded the cap, because the
  ex-container left behind became countable work that nothing recounted — no refusal, no
  audit, no notice, on the posture where the notice *is* the feature.
- A `parent`-only write never consulted the policy at all, though reparenting the last child
  out from under a row flips that row from container to leaf and raises its status's count.

So there is no "entry" concept left. `wip_counts` takes the leaf count of every capped status
before the apply; `wip_breaches` takes it again after, on the real mutated board, and reports
a status that is **over its limit** *and* **higher than it was**. Both halves matter: the first
is the cap, and the second is what keeps every write that relieves or ignores a full status
landing — an edit to a row already sitting in one, and every move out of one. An over-limit
board (a cap lowered under live work, a human edit, warn mode doing its job) stays workable
rather than frozen, and it stays so for a reason that is now a property of the comparison
rather than a special case in the code.

**"Before" means before the whole write, insertion included.** The tally is taken above the
row-insertion that a create performs, not below it — and the first cut of this redesign got
that wrong (rev-2 B4). Tallied below, a newly created row was counted on *both* sides in the
status it is born into (`queued`), so the two agreed and the comparison skipped that status:
a `queued:` cap could never fire on task creation, in either posture, silently. It is the
same class as the defect the redesign itself fixed — one input from the pre-write board,
another from a board already half-mutated — and it is worth naming as such, because the
lesson is that "the board this write started from" has to be taken before the *first* thing
the write does, not merely before the field application. The alternative (subtract the new
row back out of the `before` tally when the write is a create) was rejected for the reason
`wip_occupants` has no `skip` parameter: it is the same subtract-a-row-in-your-head shape
that produced both bugs.

A `claim` needs no special handling either: it sets `in-progress` on the row like any other
write, and the post-write board says so. That it is the motivating case — an orchestrator
starting new work while review debt grows *is* a sequence of claims — is why it gets its own
test, not why it gets its own branch.

**Only LEAF rows are counted.** A container's status is a rollup of the work its children
carry, so counting a `feature` in `in-progress` *and* the three stories under it counts the
same work twice, and makes `in-progress: 4` mean four items on a flat board and rather fewer
on a nested one — a cap nobody can reason about. #1156 made nesting the normal shape, which
is what turns this from a nicety into the difference between a cap that means something and
one that drifts with how the board happens to be structured.

**Containment decides that, never `kind`** (#1156). A row is a container because something
points at it. Counting by level instead would let any row exempt itself from every cap by
declaring `kind: epic` — and `kind` is written by the same agent, on the same call, as the
status, so a cap the caller can opt out of is not a cap. It also gives the honest answer for
the shape the strict ladder makes common: a **childless** `feature` sitting in `in-progress`
IS the work someone is doing and consumes a slot, and it stops consuming one the moment real
slices are nested under it and counted in its place.

`wip_occupants` is the **one** definition of what a cap counts, shared by the seam and by
every display, and it takes the board it is asked about — there is deliberately no `skip`
parameter, because a guard that subtracts a row out of one board while adding it to another
in its head is precisely how the first cut came to read two inputs by two rules.

## Warn by default; enforce is opt-in

`enforce: false` (the default, and what an omitted key means) makes a crossing **land**,
audit under `task-wip-crossed`, and deliver a notice to the orchestrator's pane. That
notice is not decoration — under the default posture it is the *entire* effect of the
feature, so an orchestrator that never reads it respects no cap at all. That is why
`orchestrator.md` gained a bullet in the same change: a warning changes nothing unless the
agent whose queue discipline it is has been told to read it.

Warn-first is the right default because a limit is a *guess* until a team has run under it.
A repo that discovers `review: 3` is wrong learns it from three notices, not from a week of
refusals. The refusal is what you turn on once you believe the number.

**`enforce` is board-wide, and the successor is per-status.** One bool covers every cap, so a
repo cannot enforce `review` while merely warning on `blocked` — which matters because
`blocked` is the one status where a refusal refuses an agent's *report of reality*, and the
user docs recommend not enforcing it. Today the only way to follow that advice once you
enforce anything is to leave `blocked` uncapped, which loses the warning too. A per-cap
`enforce` is the additive fix (`wip: { blocked: { limit: 4, enforce: false } }` beside the
bare-number form), and it is deliberately not in this change: it doubles the config surface
for a refinement no repo has asked for yet, and nothing here forecloses it (rev-1 N4).

## Human writes are never refused

Under `enforce: true` an agent's entry past a cap is refused. **The human's own board edit
is not, under either setting.** The rule is not a carve-out bolted on; it is the same rule
the board already keeps: *the board's authority is the human's, not a queue discipline* —
which is why `claim` is deliberately not exposed on the human's board command at all. A
limit a human declared for their agents must not bounce the human who declared it, and a
human moving a card is very often the act of *resolving* the overload the cap flagged.

Their crossing still warns and still audits (with `origin: "human"`), so the orchestrator
learns the board moved past a cap whoever moved it. It is only ever the refusal that is
agent-only.

Origin reaches the seam as a **parameter**, not as a look at `actor`. Every human path
passes the literal string `"human"` today, so an `actor == "human"` test would work — and
would be a guard a rename steps straight over, which is the failure mode this repo's
source-scanning-guard convention exists to prevent. `OrchRegistry::upsert_task` resolves to
`WriteOrigin::Agent` and `upsert_task_by_human` to `Human`, so the *stricter* posture is
the unnamed default: a new call site that forgets to think about origin gets the one that
can only ever refuse too much, and a refusal is visible.

## Reading the policy

`board_policy` mirrors `merge_queue_policy` exactly: `self.group()`, the
`advanced_orchestrator` guardrail, then a live `load_workflow` — no cache, so an edit to
the file takes effect without a restart. Two consequences worth stating:

- **It is read before `tasks_lock` is taken**, the way `with_locks` reads `lock_resources`
  before taking the lock table. `tasks_lock` is a process-global mutex serialising every
  group's board write, and a YAML open-and-parse does not belong inside it. The read is
  skipped outright for a write that cannot be an entry (an existing row, no status, no
  claim), so the hot path — a note append, a `pr` ref — stays exactly as expensive as it
  was before this feature existed.
- **An unreadable or unparseable file resolves to no caps.** That is fail-open, which is
  the wrong direction for a security check and the right one here: a WIP limit paces work
  and guards nothing (the human merge gate is not reachable from this block at all), and a
  file caught mid-save already makes the whole workflow — gates included — unenforceable
  down the loud `workflow-invalid` path. Wedging every board write behind half-written YAML
  would be a far larger claim than a pacing discipline earns.

## Surfaces

- **`list_tasks`** carries `wip: [{status, limit, count, enforce}]` beside the rows —
  empty for the repos, most of them, that declare none. It rides the board read rather than
  getting a tool of its own because a cap is only actionable next to the rows it is about;
  an orchestrator that had to make a second call would learn the limit after deciding.
- **`orch_workflow_status`** carries the same rows, computed from the same function, for
  the board pane. `refresh()` reads it in the same pass as the rows, so a chip is at most
  one refresh out of step with the list under it — the same best-effort enrichment the
  live-agent set and the question markers already are. It is a count beside a live board;
  it authorises nothing.
- **The board header** renders `review 3/3` chips (`src/wipchips.ts`, DOM-free and unit
  tested). On the header and not on a status column because this board *has* no status
  columns: it is one priority-ordered list whose order is meaning. Inventing columns for a
  feature most repos never turn on would reorder the board around it. #1105 is where the
  columns arrive, and `WipChip` already carries exactly what a column header needs.

Three fills, not two: **full** (`count >= limit`) is the state the practice is about —
start nothing new — and **over** additionally means the board is somewhere a cap says it
should not be. A two-state chip would say nothing until the board was already past the
limit.

## What the rebase onto #1151/#1152/#1156 settled

**#1152's archive cannot hide work from a cap.** `clear_done_tasks` only ever stamps rows that
are already `done`, and `done` is uncappable — so a cleared row is never sitting in a capped
status. `restore_cleared_tasks` clears the stamp and touches no status, so a restore cannot
put a status over a cap either. And the archive is read-time (`isCleared` requires the row to
STILL be `done`), so re-statusing an archived row brings it straight back into the human's
view *and* into the counts together — the chip can never show a number for work the board is
hiding.

**#1151's `sync_demo_item` stays inside `tasks_lock`.** Its own doc says so, and this change
inserts the crossing audit next to it — audit under the lock, `drop(guard)`, then the notice,
which is the ordering every other board notice already follows (delivery is best-effort and
can block).

**Deletes are not judged, deliberately.** `delete_task`/`delete_tasks`/`clear_done_tasks`
remove or archive rows; removing the last child of a container turns that container into a
leaf, so a delete *can* leave a status over a cap. Refusing a delete has no coherent relief
action — the caller is already removing work — and the board is not silent about the result:
the chip on the header recomputes from the same `wip_occupants` on the next refresh and shows
the over-cap state, and the next write that raises that status reports it. The boundary is
stated here rather than discovered.

**The crossing notice repeats, and that is intended.** A board sitting at 5/2 in warn mode
notifies on every subsequent write that raises the count. Suppressing repeats would trade
away the signal on the posture where the signal is the whole feature; at real board sizes it
is a handful of lines, and the cure for the noise is to relieve the status (rev-1 N5).

## What this deliberately does not do

- **It does not gate merges.** Nothing in `board:` is reachable from the merge gate, and
  `deny_unknown_fields` makes that structural rather than a promise.
- **It does not move work.** No auto-flip, no queueing, no "hold this until review clears".
  The board says what is true; the discipline is the agent's and the human's.
- **It does not cap agents.** That is *max live agents*, which is a different question with
  a different answer, and the point of this feature is that the two are not the same.
