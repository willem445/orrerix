//! Roles as data: the **block model** and `<repo>/.orrerix/workflow.yml` (#222;
//! the legacy `.loomux/` spelling is still discovered — see [`workflow_path`]).
//!
//! Until now an agent's identity *was* its [`Role`] — a closed 4-variant enum
//! that simultaneously decided the persona, the template, the model, the CLI
//! and the capabilities. That made "five reviewers, each with its own focus
//! prompt and model" impossible to express.
//!
//! A **block** splits those apart:
//!
//! - the **[`BlockId`]** (a string, e.g. `rev-security`) is the *identity*;
//! - [`Role`] survives as the block's **capability class** (`kind`) — the
//!   structural guarantees loomux enforces (deny-flags, cwd rule, MCP tool
//!   scope) still come from a **closed enum**;
//! - persona (`prompt` / `profile`), `cli` and `model` are **unbounded data**.
//!
//! So you can declare as many reviewers as you like — but every one of them is a
//! *reviewer* in the capability sense, and a repo file cannot make one anything
//! else.
//!
//! Be precise about what "the capability sense" buys, because the enum enforces
//! less than the word suggests — [`Role::containment`](crate::model::Role::containment)
//! is the exact per-class answer. A **planner** is structurally read-only — its
//! file-editing tools and `git commit`/`git push` are denied at the CLI level, so
//! `is_read_only()` is a real, mechanical guarantee. A **reviewer** is denied the
//! CLI's file-editing tools too (#462), but keeps the shell — running the tests
//! is its job — so its "never pushes" stays *instruction-backed*, and so does
//! "never writes a file" for anything a shell command can do. What the closed
//! enum guarantees is that a repo file cannot *change* which posture a block
//! gets — not that any posture is a sandbox. (See
//! `doc/design/orchestration.md` on structural vs instruction-backed enforcement;
//! the capability table in `doc/design/workflows.md` is the honest summary.)
//!
//! # The capability-closure rule (the security spine)
//!
//! **A workflow file can never grant a capability.** `kind` *selects* from the
//! closed enum; there is no `read_only: false` escape hatch, no `allow_write`,
//! no way to spell a fifth capability class. A repo file is untrusted input —
//! it is authored by whoever opened a PR against the repo — and under
//! `auto_ops` nobody approves its agents' tool calls. Everything a block can
//! influence is therefore either (a) inert text (a persona prompt), or (b) a
//! choice from a value set loomux already ships (`kind`, `cli`, `model`).
//! Every string that reaches a shell line is sanitized first ([`sanitize_id`],
//! [`sanitize_display`], `sanitize_allow`, `sanitize_model`), and a `profile:`
//! path is confined to the repo (no `..`, no absolute paths, no drive letters).
//!
//! # Failure policy
//!
//! A broken workflow file is **audited and skipped, never fatal**: the group
//! falls back to [`default_roster`] — today's fixed 4-block roster — and every
//! agent still spawns. The one thing that is *not* silently tolerated is an
//! unknown `kind`: coercing it to `worker` would hand an unrecognized block
//! write access, so it is a hard validation error that drops the file. (The
//! pre-#222 code did exactly that coercion in two places; both are gone.)

/// The `base-green` reductions (#1174) — **one definition, two consumers**: the
/// `gh` shim interpolates these constants into its POSIX body, and
/// `mqdriver::base_check_runs_argv`/`base_status_argv` pass them to `gh --jq`.
///
/// They live here, with the rest of the gate contract, precisely because the
/// first cut had a *copy* in each place. The two were byte-identical, which
/// looked like the two-implementations-one-contract property holding — and it
/// was, but what the contract SAID was wrong in both, and nothing could have
/// told them apart from two copies that had drifted. A shared constant makes
/// "the shim and the queue ask GitHub the same question" a fact about the
/// program rather than a claim in a PR body.
///
/// Each reduces a JSON payload to ONE word from a closed vocabulary —
/// `red` | `truncated` | `pending` | `none` | `green` — because the shim has no
/// JSON parser and must decide a merge from a shell `case`.
///
/// **The clause order is the contract, and each step earns its place:**
///
/// 1. **`red` first, and only for COMPLETED runs.** A visible failure is the
///    most actionable answer, so it outranks everything below — but a run still
///    in progress carries `conclusion: null`, which the conclusion allow-list
///    would otherwise call red. Reporting "the base is RED" about a base that
///    is merely still building would be a false sentence in a refusal, so
///    `.status == "completed"` guards it.
/// 2. **`truncated` next — the #1181 review's blocking finding.**
///    `/commits/{ref}/check-runs` is **paginated**: `check_runs` is capped at
///    `per_page` while `total_count` counts them all. `any(.check_runs[]; …)`
///    therefore asks "is anything on THIS PAGE red", and before this clause a
///    base with more runs than one page — an ordinary OS x version matrix,
///    exactly the repo that adopts a stop-the-line gate — reported **green**
///    with its failures sitting on page 2. Reproduced against this repo's own
///    API: a commit with 3 `failure` runs answered `red` at full page size and
///    `green` at `?per_page=3`. A page that does not carry every run says
///    nothing about the runs it omits, so it is not an answer.
/// 3. `pending`, then `none`, then `green` — the residue, unchanged.
///
/// **The shape the payload is ASSUMED to have is checked, not assumed (#1181
/// rev-lead NB5).** `total_count` is documented as always present, and the
/// truncation clause above rests entirely on it — but jq sorts `null` below
/// every number, so an absent key makes `.total_count > (.check_runs|length)`
/// evaluate `null > N`, which is **false**, and the expression falls straight
/// through to `green`. That is round one's defect wearing a different hat: an
/// unstated assumption about the payload, failing open, in the one clause whose
/// whole premise is that unknown is never green. `has("total_count")` answers
/// `truncated` instead, so a payload that cannot support the question refuses
/// rather than passing.
///
/// **[`BASE_STATUS_JQ`] carries the same guard over ITS inputs**, which the
/// review did not ask for and this repo's own rule requires: a guard reads every
/// one of its inputs by one rule, and taking one signal from a checked shape and
/// the next from an unchecked one is a bypass exactly the width of that
/// asymmetry. `null | length` is `0` in jq rather than an error, so an absent
/// `statuses` would read as the *definite* claim "this commit has no legacy
/// statuses"; an absent `state` would fall to the `else` and report `red`,
/// which refuses but says something false about the base while doing it.
///
/// **Only the check-runs half needs the truncation clause**, and the asymmetry
/// is worth stating rather than leaving to be re-derived: the combined-status
/// endpoint carries a top-level `.state` that is GitHub's own rollup across
/// *all* statuses, so [`BASE_STATUS_JQ`] is pagination-proof by construction.
/// `check-runs` has no rollup field — only `total_count` — which is why one
/// half was safe and the other was not.

///    defect" does not stop being true because the author pushed more code. The
///    reviewer clears it by re-reviewing and re-recording.)
/// 2. **A `pass` only counts for the revision it reviewed.** A pass recorded
///    against an earlier head is *stale*: the branch moved, and what that reviewer
///    approved is not what would merge. It counts as outstanding, not as a pass —
///    which is why GitHub's own review model dismisses stale approvals on new
///    commits, and it is the #197 failure class ("merging code no reviewer saw")
///    that a PR-keyed verdict would have left wide open.
/// 3. Then the live PASS count must reach [`gate_need`]. Under `all-pass` that
///    means every named reviewer has passed *this* revision — a reviewer that
///    hasn't recorded anything keeps the gate shut, which is precisely the bug that
