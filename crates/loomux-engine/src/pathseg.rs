//! `PathSegment` — the one validated-identifier mechanism every caller-supplied
//! id that becomes a path component is expressed through (#925).
//!
//! # Why this exists as one type rather than one type per family
//!
//! #904 closed `group_id` with [`GroupId`](crate::groupid::GroupId): one
//! validating constructor, a strict alphabet, `Deserialize` through the same
//! gate, and no `AsRef<Path>`. #925 is the same treatment for what #904
//! deliberately left — and the obvious way to write it is a second newtype per
//! remaining family, each re-spelling the same five checks.
//!
//! That would have made the *fourth* copy of those checks, not the second. All
//! of these already existed, all of them answering "is this string usable as a
//! single path component":
//!
//! | validator | rules |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | `GroupId::parse` | non-empty, ≤64, `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`, no leading `-`, no device name |
//! | `mergeq::valid_id_component` | non-empty, ≤64, `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`, no leading `-` |
//! | `orchestration::sanitize_session` | non-empty, ≤64, `[A-Za-z0-9_-]` |
//! | `orchestration::digest::is_safe_session_id` | non-empty, no `/`, no `\`, not `.`/`..` |
//!
//! Read down that table and the problem is not the duplication, it is the
//! **drift**: the four are not the same check, they are four points on a slope,
//! and the weakest of them was the one guarding a live `Path::join`
//! (`read_session_transcript_events`'s copilot arm). A rule copied four times is
//! a rule that is only as strong as whichever copy an attacker reaches.
//!
//! So the mechanism is one type, and a family that needs its own *shape* wraps
//! it rather than restating it. `GroupId` stays a distinct type — a group id and
//! a session id must not be interchangeable at a call site — but it no longer
//! owns a private copy of the rules; it delegates here.
//!
//! # The alphabet, and why it is this one
//!
//! Identical to `GroupId`'s, and for the same reason: every id in this family is
//! **loomux-minted or vendor-minted**, never user prose. Claude session ids are
//! hyphenated hex UUIDs, opencode's are `ses_` + hex + base62, group ids are
//! `{slug}-{8hex}`, merge-queue batch ids are `mq-{hex}`. A strict alphabet
//! therefore costs nothing real and rejects every path-shaped attack by
//! construction rather than by enumeration:
//!
//! - `.` is not in it, so `..` and `.` are **unspellable** — no traversal;
//! - `/` and `\` are not in it, so no id names more than one component;
//! - `:` is not in it, so no drive letter and no NTFS alternate data stream;
//! - NUL, every other control byte and all whitespace are out, so no truncation
//!   at the syscall and no log-line injection;
//! - non-ASCII is out, which is where Unicode normalization and homoglyph
//!   confusion would otherwise live.
//!
//! The two rules that are not consequences of the alphabet each earn their own
//! line. A leading `-` is a legal path component but an *option* to any command
//! line the id is interpolated into. And a Windows reserved device name (`CON`,
//! `NUL`, `COM3`, …) is a path that opens a device rather than naming a file.
//!
//! ## `:` is not a theoretical entry on that list
//!
//! `is_safe_session_id` — the weakest row in the table above — rejected `/`,
//! `\`, `.` and `..` and nothing else, and it guarded
//! `copilot_session_state_root().join(session_id)`. `"C:"` passed it. On
//! Windows `"C:"` parses as a `Prefix` component, and `Path::join` **replaces**
//! the receiver when the argument carries a prefix — so the "session directory"
//! became `C:`, and the read that followed resolved drive-relative to the
//! process's own current directory, outside the session-state root entirely. No
//! separator required.
//!
//! # Refused, never rewritten
//!
//! [`PathSegment::parse`] does not trim, lowercase or sanitize. An id is either
//! usable exactly as written or it is refused. Normalizing would let two
//! distinct strings name one directory, which is how a membership check and a
//! path join end up disagreeing about which thing they are talking about.
//!
//! This is the one place the older validators genuinely differed rather than
//! merely drifting: `mergeq::valid_id_component` and
//! `orchestration::sanitize_session` both `trim()` first. Neither is converted
//! here — that would be a behavior change (`" mq-1 "` is accepted today) wearing
//! a refactor's clothes, and it is not what #925 asks for.
//!
//! # Deliberately not implemented: `AsRef<Path>`
//!
//! A `PathSegment` must not be joinable directly, for the same reason a
//! `GroupId` must not be: holding a validated id is not the same as being
//! allowed to build a path from it wherever you like. The absence is what makes
//! the compiler — not a textual scan — the thing that stops a validated id
//! reaching an undeclared `join` as a *value*.
//!
//! Because of Rust's orphan rule, the only crate an
//! `impl AsRef<Path> for PathSegment` can be written in is this one. The
//! source-scanning tests in `src-tauri/tests/groupid.rs` assert its absence and
//! walk this crate's source root for exactly that reason; see
//! `doc/design/groupid-and-path-roots.md`.
