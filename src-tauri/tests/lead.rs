//! The **lead pane's capability class** (#2519 slice A): what `Role::Lead` may

//! lands.
//!
//! Its own integration-test binary rather than more of `orchestration.rs`, for
//! `manager_lifecycle.rs`'s two reasons. The mechanical one: an end-of-file
//! append to that file conflicts on its shared trailing tokens rather than on
//! its content (CLAUDE.md's git section), so concurrent slices splice into each
//! other's final assertion. The real one: these tests are one subject — one
//! capability class — and belong together for a reader.
//!
//! An integration test (not a unit test) because a test executable linking the
//! full lib needs the common-controls-v6 manifest `build.rs` embeds via
//! `rustc-link-arg-tests` — CLAUDE.md constraint 4.
//!
//! No test here spawns a real agent CLI (constraint 3): panes are registry
//! entries, deliveries are observed through the queue and the audit log, and
//! nothing is executed.
//!
//! **What slice A can and cannot cover, stated once.** There is no launch path
//! for a lead yet (`orch_lead_prepare` is slice B), and that is deliberate —
//! `workflow::kind_from_str` has no `lead` arm, so neither a workflow file nor
//! `spawn_agent` can mint one. Every fixture here therefore builds the lead
//! block itself, through `workflow::default_roster`, which is the same
//! construction slice B's group-minting will use. What that does NOT cover is
//! the launcher's own refusals and the group-creation invariant ("exactly one
//! root"), because neither exists to test yet; both land with the code that
//! creates them.
