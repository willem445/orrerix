// Liveness probes for the soak lane (#1603, plan #1600 §3 Phase 4.1).
//
// Everything in this file exists to answer one question the rest of this
// repo's guards structurally cannot (plan #1600 §2.2): **after the app has
// been running for a while under load, does a keystroke still reach a pane
// and does the MCP still answer?** Four hangs — #1564, #1592, #1595 and the
// beta6 field report — shipped past a growing wall of source scans, because a
// source scan pins the shape of the last incident and this is a liveness
// property.
//
// Three design choices here are load-bearing rather than incidental:
//
// - **Every probe is bounded by its own deadline, not by Playwright's test
//   timeout.** The failure under test is a HANG. A probe that simply awaited
//   would turn every red into "Test timeout of 120000ms exceeded" with no
//   statement of which half died, and would make the expected-failure marker
//   on the class assertion unreliable. Each probe returns `{ ok, ms }` and the
//   spec asserts on that, so a hang reads as a named assertion failure with a
//   measured elapsed time.
// - **The MCP probe goes over real HTTP from the Playwright process**, not
//   through the webview. The webview is the half of the app that stays alive
//   in the beta6 mechanism (its thread is untouched — that is why the window
//   still paints), so asking it whether the backend is well is asking the
//   wrong process. `tiny_http` + `std::thread::spawn` per request is what the
//   orchestrator actually talks to, so that is what gets probed.
// - **Nothing here spawns an agent CLI** (CLAUDE.md constraint 3). The MCP
//   token comes from `orch_solo_prepare`, which mints a token and writes the
//   config file *before* any pane process is spawned and independently of
//   whether the CLI is even installed — so calling that command alone yields
//   a working MCP identity with no child process anywhere.

/**
 * Types a command into the focused pane and waits for the CHILD's own output
 * to come back. Two separately-bounded phases, never the test timeout.
 *
 * **Why two phases.** They are two different properties, they fail for
 * different reasons, and they cost wildly different amounts of time:
 *
 * - *Input.* The command is typed with real key events, and `src/ptywrite.ts`
 *   keeps exactly one `write_pty` in flight per pane, chaining the next on the
 *   previous promise (#65) — so every character is a full IPC round trip, and
 *   this phase is the one the beta6 report is actually about: a `write_pty`
 *   that never resolves stops that pane accepting input forever, with the
 *   window still painting. It ends when the typed stem echoes back.
 *
 *   The SYMPTOM is unchanged by #1607 and the frontend chain is why: one
 *   write in flight per pane means one unresolved promise is still enough to
 *   wedge that pane. What changed is the cause it can have. `write_pty` no
 *   longer hands off to the shared blocking pool at all — it enqueues to the
 *   pane's own writer thread and awaits that thread's reply — so pool
 *   exhaustion is no longer among the ways this probe can fail, and a red
 *   here now points at the writer thread or the ConPTY write behind it.
 * - *Answer.* Enter is pressed and the CHILD's own output has to arrive. This
 *   is one write and one read, so it is fast whenever it works at all.
 *
 * Collapsing them into one clock is what the first CI run on this branch did,
 * and the result was a probe that timed out mid-typing and reported it as "no
 * output" — a slow input path indistinguishable from a dead child.
 *
 * **Why the marker is shaped the way it is.** The command is
 * `echo <marker>%RANDOM%` and the match is `/<marker>\d+/`. The text typed in
 * contains the literal `%RANDOM%`, whose next character is `%` and not a
 * digit, so the echo of the typed line cannot match — only `cmd.exe` expanding
 * it can. A pane that rendered the keystrokes locally but never reached, or
 * never heard back from, its child cannot produce a match. The marker is kept
 * SHORT for the reason above: every character costs a round trip.

 * directly therefore yields a valid token and the server's ephemeral port
 * (which is bound at `127.0.0.1:0` in `mcp::serve` and is not otherwise
 * discoverable) with no child process anywhere. CLAUDE.md constraint 3 is
 * about spawning agent CLIs; this spawns nothing.
 *
 * The config's exact JSON layout differs per CLI, so the url/header pair is
 * located by SHAPE — an object carrying a `/mcp` url and a headers map —
 * rather than by a hard-coded key path that would break silently on the next
 * CLI added.
