// One binary name and one bundle identifier, everywhere (#1562 slices A and B).
//
// Two axes, two halves of this file. The first is the executable's name; the
// second, at the bottom, is the Tauri bundle identifier. They are independent
// values that fail the same way — several files spell each one out by hand,
// and a HALF-rename of either is worse than no rename — so they are policed by
// the same two instruments, and the identifier half is written as a deliberate
// mirror of the binary half rather than as something new to learn.
//
// The executable's basename is not configured anywhere: `mainBinaryName` is
// unset in `tauri.conf.json`, so Tauri ships "the output binary from cargo" —
// which means `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`'s `[package] name` IS the name of the
// installed exe, of `target/release/<name>.pdb`, of the WER dump files, of the
// `--webview-exe-name=` argument WebView2 passes its browser process, and of
// `cargo … -p <name>`. Several files spell that name out by hand.
//
// Renaming the package is therefore a many-site edit with nothing mechanical
// holding the sites together, and a HALF-rename is worse than none: CI's E2E
// job would launch a path that does not exist, `symbolicate.yml` would build a
// package cargo no longer has, `release.yml` would zip a missing PDB, and
// `scripts/check-versions.js` would stop finding the lockfile entry it reads
// the release version out of — each failing in a different workflow, at a
// different time, with nothing saying "you renamed one thing".
//
// So: one name, taken from the manifest, asserted at every site that spells it.
// This test is deliberately green in BOTH consistent states (all `loomux`, all
// `orrerix`) — it polices agreement, not a particular spelling, which is what
// makes it survive the rename it was written for.
//
// Two instruments, because named sites and exhaustive shapes fail differently:
//
//   - SITES is the specific half. Each row names the one construct that must
//     carry the binary name, so a stale one fails with a message a reader can
//     act on. It cannot see a site nobody thought to list.
//   - The SHAPE scan is the exhaustive half, and it is default-deny: every
//     `<token>.exe` / `<token>.pdb` in those files must BE the binary name or
//     be on ALLOW with a reason. It decides on the shape of the token, never on
//     the name of the binding around it, so a rename cannot step over it. Its
//     regex is cross-checked against a raw count of `.exe`/`.pdb` in the same
//     file, so a pattern that cannot see one of its own subjects fails as a
//     blind instrument rather than passing as "no offenders".
//
// What the SHAPE half does NOT see, stated rather than left to be discovered:
// the binary's name where it appears WITHOUT its extension — `Contents/MacOS/
// <name>`, `/usr/bin/<name>`, `-p <name>`, `cargo … -p <name>`. There is no
// shape to key on there; a bare word is just a word. Those sites are covered by
// SITES rows instead, which means they are covered only where someone listed
// them: a NEW file that names the binary bare is invisible to this test. The
// same is true of a name assembled at runtime (`"orrer" + "ix.exe"`). Neither
// exists today.

// The bundle identifier (#1562 slice B)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// `tauri.conf.json`'s `identifier` is the app's identity to the OS. On Windows
// and Linux, Tauri resolves the webview's user-data folder from it —
// `<data_local_dir>/<identifier>`, holding the WebView2 `localStorage` a user's
// recent repos, default agent and editor command live in — and on macOS it is
// the `CFBundleIdentifier` the microphone (TCC) grant is keyed on.
//
// It is spelled in four places that must agree, in three languages:
//
//   - `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` — what the shipped build actually IS;
//   - `crates/loomux-engine/src/brand.rs` — `BUNDLE_ID`, what the Rust that
//     performs the one-time profile move believes it is. A disagreement here is
//     silent by construction: `init_webview_profile_from` no-ops for any
//     identifier that is not `BUNDLE_ID`, so the move simply never happens and
//     every existing user's preferences are quietly reset instead;
//   - `src-tauri/tauri.e2e.conf.json` — the E2E build's DIFFERENT identifier,
//     which is the whole of the isolation argument in docs/design/e2e-testing.md
//     (#394: WebView2 keys its shared browser process off the identifier);
//   - `e2e/fixtures.ts` — `EXPECTED_IDENTIFIER`, which the harness verifies the
//     spawned build's WebView2 child is really running under before it drives
//     anything. Stale, and the harness refuses a build that is fine, or accepts
//     one that is not.
//
// Same two instruments as the binary half: named sites (specific, actionable,
// blind to a site nobody listed) plus a default-deny shape scan over every
// `dev.<x>.<y>` token in those files, cross-checked against a raw count of
// `dev.` in the same file so a pattern that cannot see one of its own subjects
// fails as a blind instrument rather than passing as "no offenders".
//
// What the identifier half does NOT see, stated rather than left to be found:
// the identifier where it appears WITHOUT its `dev.` prefix, and the profile
// directory named by a variable (`<data_local_dir>/<identifier>`) rather than
// spelled. Neither exists today.
//
// One more, because it is live rather than hypothetical: `ID_SHAPE` reads two
// dot-separated segments and stops, so a SUPERSTRING of an identifier —
// `dev.orrerix.app.other`, a deliberate near-miss specimen in `obs.rs`'s
// `a_non_production_identifier_never_moves_the_profile` — matches as
// `dev.orrerix.app` and is counted as the product identifier. Harmless in that
// direction (it is not reported as an offender when it should not be), and the
// raw cross-check below stays consistent because both patterns see it once. It
// would matter if someone introduced a real third-segment identifier, which
// nothing does. It also cannot check what Tauri does with the
// value — that the shipped build's WebView2 child really runs under it is what
// the `e2e-windows` job proves, and nothing here substitutes for reading it.
