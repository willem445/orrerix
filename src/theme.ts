// The loomux palette — the single source of truth for every colour loomux paints (#879).
//
// WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS. loomux's colours live in three languages that cannot see each
// other: the `:root` custom properties in styles.css, the critical pre-paint `background`
// in index.html (which must be right BEFORE the bundle loads, or the app flashes the wrong
// colour at startup), and the xterm.js ITheme in pane.ts (terminals render on a WebGL
// canvas — CSS custom properties are invisible to them). Before this module the three were
// hand-kept in sync, which is to say they were not: the pre-paint hex and the stylesheet's
// app ground agreed only because nobody had changed one of them yet.
//
// So: the values live here, in DOM-free TypeScript that a node:test can read, and the other
// two surfaces are PINNED TO IT by test/theme.test.ts rather than by good intentions. The
// pin is a test plus a comment, deliberately — build-time CSS codegen would be a build step
// and a generated file to review for one shared seam (doc/design/ui-redesign.md, §Pinning).
//
// The design brief this implements — palette rationale, the three colour channels, the
// elevation model, the signature element, the type roles, and the maintainability rules
// every later slice is held to — is doc/design/ui-redesign.md. Read it before changing a
// value here; in particular, a hue is not free to move between channels.
//
// DOM-free on purpose: node:test imports this directly (no jsdom, no bundler).

/**
 * Two neutral ramps, eight named hues, and a seven-pigment per-CLI set that answers one
 * closed question in one position (see `CLI_HUES`).
 *
 * `slate` is ACHROMATIC — `r === g === b` at every step, and so is `mist`. It used to lean
 * cool (blue 3-17 points above red as the ramp climbed), which read as a blue cast across
 * the whole chrome; #1320 ask 1 removed it. Each step was collapsed to its own GREEN channel,
 * which holds luminance nearly constant (luminance is 71.52% green), so the elevation ladder
 * and every contrast ratio survived the change while the hue did not — the largest step
 * moved 1.4%. `mist` is the ink, and it is the "silver" half of the black-and-gold identity.
 *
 * THE OLDER RULE SURVIVES, BUT ONLY FOR THE CHANNEL IT WAS EVER TRUE OF: **the INTERACTION
 * channel enters through the foreground only — the accent paints marks, edges, rings and
 * carets, never a ground.** That is measured, not asserted: `test/theme.test.ts` ("the accent
 * paints marks, never grounds") denies `var(--accent)` in a `background` by default.
 *
 * The STATE and IDENTITY channels still wash grounds, by design and with the design note's
 * role table sanctioning it — an awaiting-human task row, an urgent decision card, diff
 * add/delete lines. So the palette-wide version of this sentence is FALSE, and it used to be
 * written here as "unchanged and now literally true", which is precisely the claim #1340 was
 * filed against: the ramp was achromatic while `selectionFill` was gold, and a ground nobody
 * had measured carried the tint the human could see. Do not restore the universal form. The
 * whole argument, the still-washed grounds and the open product question live in
 * doc/design/ui-redesign.md, §The ground.
 *
 * The eight hues serve THREE channels, not one (design note, §The three colour channels):
 * *state* (what an agent is doing), *interaction* (what the human can act on), and
 * *identity* (which thing this is — a surface, an action family, a CLI, a git lane). Four
 * of the eight also carry a state role; that is one pigment answering two questions, and
 * what keeps them apart is POSITION, not hue — see `IDENTITY` below.

  // --- slate: the ground and the elevation ladder, deepest first. The four SURFACE steps
  //     are deliberately tiny — 1.041, 1.055, 1.087:1 between neighbours — because surfaces
  //     separate by elevation and a hairline, never by a contrast block. The two BORDER
  //     steps above them open up (1.146, 1.245:1): an edge has to be seen to do its job.
  slate000: "#0b0b0b", // terminal ground — the deepest surface in the app
  slate100: "#111111", // app ground (html/body, and the pre-paint hex in index.html)
  slate200: "#171717", // panels, bars, headers, the rail
  slate300: "#1f1f1f", // raised: cards, inputs, hovered rows, popovers
  slate400: "#2a2a2a", // hairline borders
  slate500: "#393939", // strong borders, idle threads, disabled edges

  // --- mist: the ink. `mist400` is BELOW 4.5:1 on every ground by design — it is for
  //     non-essential meta and rules only. Anything a user must read uses mist200 or better.
  //
  //     mist000 was toned down from its original 15.6:1 (#e7e9ee) at the human's request —
  //     "a little extreme" against the near-black grounds (#1020 item 11). The candidate
  //     matrix considered, measured against slate100 (the app ground) with the identical
  //     WCAG formula test/theme.test.ts runs, all comfortably clear the ramp's own AAA floor
  //     (>=7:1 on every ground, test: "the ink ramp keeps the contrast the design note
  //     promises") with room to spare even on slate300, the lightest ground it sits on:
  //
  //     The candidates below are the #1020 set carried through #1320's de-blueing — each
  //     collapsed to its own green channel, which is what held the ramp's luminance while
  //     the hue left. That the ratios barely moved (13.50 -> 13.51, 12.49 -> 12.49,
  //     11.53 -> 11.52) IS the evidence for that claim, not a coincidence:
  //
  //       candidate      hex        surface0   surface1   surface2   surfaceTerm
  //       mild trim      #dadada    13.51:1    12.82:1    11.79:1    14.08:1

  //       strong trim    #cacaca    11.52:1    10.94:1    10.06:1    12.01:1
  //
  //     Terminal consequence: none of these candidates touch TERMINAL_THEME.brightWhite
  //     (below) — it is its own literal, not PALETTE.mist000, precisely so that swapping the
  //     candidate here can never again silently re-paint the terminal's bright-white slot. It
  //     did once: shipping DEFAULT while brightWhite aliased mist000 put brightWhite (L
  //     0.6437) BELOW `foreground` (L 0.6921), inverting bright-white emphasis in every pane
  //     (#1033 review) — see the brightWhite comment in TERMINAL_THEME.
  //
  //     DEFAULT was picked as the midpoint of the requested ~12-13:1 band. Which candidate
  //     reads right is a human call at the demo (#1020 human input 4) — swap this one hex
  //     to move the whole app; nothing else here needs to change (styles.css / index.html
  //     stay pinned to whichever value lands here). The surface ladder itself (below) was
  //     deliberately left untouched: its steps are already at the finest gap 8-bit hex can
  //     express at this luminance (adjacent hex values differ by ~0.02:1 of contrast here),
  //     so softening it further either does nothing visible or risks breaking the strictly-
  //     increasing elevation order for no perceptible gain — a call for a design slice with
  //     room to re-derive the whole ladder, not a same-day tone-down.
  mist000: "#d2d2d2", // primary ink            (12.5:1 on slate100)
  mist200: "#a3a3a3", // secondary ink          (7.4:1)
  mist400: "#6d6d6d", // faint meta / dividers  (3.2-3.8:1 — non-text use only)

  // --- the eight hues, warm to cool around the wheel. Every one clears AA (4.5:1) as text
  //     on every slate ground including slate300, so a hue is legible on any surface
  //     without a per-surface exception; the worst case is rose at 4.61:1. Each carries a
  //     `Lit` step — the brighter companion used for ANSI bright, for hover emphasis, and
  //     for chip text sitting on a hairline of the same hue. There is deliberately no
  //     per-hue FILL: on this ground a chip is the ground plus a hairline, so a third
  //     value per hue would be a token nothing paints (design note, §The Lit step).
  rose: "#e35a5a", //     state: danger / error / deletions — a TRUE red (hue 0), not the
  roseLit: "#ee8080", //   pink-leaning rose it replaces (#1320 ask 3, "red = error/dead")
  amber: "#e89c3c", //    state: attention — pulled toward orange from its old yellow-orange,
  amberLit: "#f2b45f", //  as far toward it as tritanopia allows (see SEMANTIC.stateAttention)
  lime: "#b5bf62", //     identity only — brass, down from a candy yellow-green

  jade: "#35a86b", //     state: ok / done / additions
  jadeLit: "#56c48c",
  cyan: "#5aa8b5", //     identity, and ANSI cyan — muted teal, not the old bright cyan
  cyanLit: "#7ec3ce",
  azure: "#6f93c4", //    identity, and ANSI blue. NO LONGER a state dye nor the accent:
  azureLit: "#95b3d8", //  after #1320 this pigment never paints chrome, only a lane or glyph
  violet: "#9a8fc4", //   identity, and ANSI magenta — slate-violet, down from a lilac
  violetLit: "#b7aed8",
  orchid: "#c47f9e", //   identity only — dusty rose, down from a hot pink
  orchidLit: "#d8a2bb",

  // --- the interaction pigment, and the one state pigment that is not also an identity hue.
  //
  //     gold is the BRAND accent (#1320 ask 2): black + gold/silver is the post-rebrand
  //     identity, and this is the orrery gold off the logo, tempered a little off its
  //     #ffc82a core so that a caret and a focus ring are not the brightest thing on the
  //     screen. Before #1320 the interaction channel had no pigment of its own — it
  //     borrowed `azure` from the state channel, which is why "what can I click" and "what
  //     is this doing" were the same colour. There is no `silver` token: the silver half of
  //     the identity IS the `mist` ramp, which is now genuinely achromatic.
  //
  //     spring is `working`. It exists because the direction puts BOTH running and done on
  //     green, and two states may never share a pigment — so `jade` keeps `ok` and the
  //     brighter, mintier `spring` takes the live thread. It sits 10.1 dE from `ansiGreen`
  //     below: two near-identical greens in one palette is the smell the token layer exists
  //     to prevent, so this one is far enough away to be its own pigment.
  gold: "#f8c93e", //     interaction: the accent, the focus ring, the caret
  spring: "#74d98d", //   state: working / live
  selectionFill: "#323232", // selection fill only — never text, never a border. ACHROMATIC.
  //     It is a GROUND and it belongs to the INTERACTION channel, so it takes that channel's
  //     rule (see the ramp doc above): the accent paints marks, never grounds. #1320 broke
  //     that — it de-blued the
  //     ramp and in the same slice made this a deep GOLD wash (#38321f), which is what the
  //     human saw as "the gold hue is tinting everything" (#1340), because this token is the
  //     ground under every selected file row, every open editor row, every active workflow
  //     row and every terminal text selection. Gold is the accent; an accent does not paint
  //     the floor.
  //
  //     De-tinted by the SAME method the ramp itself was de-blued with, not by eye:
  //     collapsed to its own GREEN channel (0x32), which is 71.52% of luminance, so the two
  //     jobs a selection has both survive to three decimal places. It must be visible as a
  //     fill on the app ground (1.473:1, against the gold's 1.478:1) AND text must stay
  //     readable on top of it (ink 8.480:1, against 8.448:1; the accent itself 8.191:1,
  //     against 8.159:1). Contrast is what sets its LEVEL and that has not moved: the
  //     rejected #2e2a1c draft dropped the fill to 1.32:1, and a selection you can read but
  //     can barely see is still a regression.

  // --- the per-CLI brand hues (#1020 wave 2, an eighth added by #2126). Eight pigments that
  //     exist for ONE position —
  //     the agent-type mark and the session list's CLI chip — and answer one closed
  //     question: *which program is this pane running*. They are not a ninth..fifteenth
  //     identity hue and they do not compete with the eight above; see `CLI_HUES` for why
  //     they had to be their own set rather than borrowed `--id-*` tokens.
  //
  //     EVOCATION, NOT REPLICATION. Where a vendor has a well-known palette the pigment
  //     leans toward it — clay for Anthropic's warm terracotta, teal for OpenAI's green,
  //     steel for GitHub's blue, indigo for Gemini's blue-violet — but no value here is a
  //     vendor's own hex, and none is presented as one. A trademark colour copied exactly
  //     is a claim of affiliation loomux does not make and does not need: the same
  //     nominative-use reasoning that lets agenticons.ts draw GitHub's own glyph (§Licensing
  //     there) is why it may lean toward GitHub's blue without taking it. The four CLIs
  //     whose vendors publish no colour identity at all (opencode, hermes, ante, pi) get hues
  //     loomux picked outright, for separation and nothing else.
  //
  //     No `Lit` step: unlike the eight, nothing paints an emphasis tier of a CLI hue — a
  //     mark is one flat glyph and a chip is a 16% wash of the base. A step nothing paints
  //     is a token the pin cannot check (design note, §The Lit step).
  clay: "#e08a5f", //     claude   — warm terracotta
  citron: "#c3c455", //   ante     — yellow-green
  fern: "#5fc873", //     opencode — a true green
  teal: "#3ec2a8", //     codex    — green-cyan
  steel: "#7fa8d8", //    copilot  — a cool desaturated blue
  indigo: "#9677c5", //   gemini   — blue-violet, muted at #1320 ask 3
  fuchsia: "#b67c94", //  hermes   — dusty mauve, muted at #1320 ask 3
  cerulean: "#00d2f0", // pi       — a bright sky-cyan, and the brightest of the eight. That is
  //     forced rather than chosen: the one hue region the other seven leave empty is
  //     cyan-through-blue, and codex's teal and copilot's steel crowd its muted middle, so
  //     everything below L* ~74 there lands inside the 30 ΔE floor. The search that produced
  //     this value is in the PR for #2126; what matters here is that a tempered #4ccfe8 measures
  //     28.5 ΔE from copilot and is therefore not available.

  // --- the four AGILE-LEVEL pigments (#3261). Like the CLI hues above they exist for ONE
  //     position — the task board's kind mark and its kind chip — and answer one closed
  //     question: *which level of the ladder is this row*. `KIND_HUES` says why they could
  //     not be borrowed `--id-*` tokens, and why the unlabelled row deliberately has no
  //     pigment here at all.
  //
  //     Measured, on the same instruments `test/theme.test.ts` uses and re-derives (CIE76
  //     over the Viénot simulation; WCAG for contrast): every one of the four clears AA as
  //     text on every slate ground, worst case `mulberry` at 5.14:1 on slate300. Across all
  //     five marks including the unlabelled one, the closest pair is 40.0 ΔE normal, and
  //     under simulation protan 12.8 (ember/moss), deutan 15.9 (mulberry/unlabelled),
  //     tritan 10.0 (ember/mulberry) — so this set does NOT collapse under CVD, unlike the
  //     CLI octet, which is what four pigments buys that eight cannot.
  //
  //     The nearest EXISTING pigment to any of them is `steel` (copilot's mark), 6.2 ΔE
  //     from `cobalt`; `ember` sits 8.7 from `clay` (claude's). Stated rather than tuned
  //     away, and on the CLI table's own argument: distance matters between pigments that
  //     appear in the same position, and a CLI mark never appears on a board row's kind
  //     mark. Tuning `cobalt` off `steel` costs the CVD floor above, which is the number
  //     that decides whether a human can read the ladder at all.
  //
  //     No `Lit` step, for `CLI_HUES`' reason: nothing paints an emphasis tier of a level.
  ember: "#e08a4e", //     epic    — the container everything else sits in
  moss: "#72c072", //      feature
  cobalt: "#6aa6de", //    story
  mulberry: "#c9769b", //  task    — the leaf

  // --- terminal-only. ANSI wants a true green in a slot where the app's greens are a teal
  //     (jade) and a yellow-green (lime); neither reads as "green" to a CLI, so ANSI green
  //     keeps its own pull. It is NOT an app hue — no UI surface may use it. `cyan` and
  //     `violet` used to live in this group and have been promoted to the identity channel,
  //     which is why it is now three names rather than seven.

/**
 * The identity channel: hue used to say WHICH thing this is, not what state it is in.
 *
 * Surfaces that consume this: coloured icons and their role table, per-CLI marks, git-graph
 * lanes, diff add/delete, task-board columns, workflow-mode chrome, project tabs, resource
 * meters, and the syntax sub-palette. All eight hues are available to it, including the
 * three that also carry a state role — loomux has ONE palette, not two, and minting a second
 * near-identical pigment so that the identity copy could differ from the state copy is
 * exactly the failure the token layer exists to prevent. (The rule is stated without naming
 * a hue on purpose: it used to read "identity blue" versus "working blue", which #1320
 * falsified when `working` moved off azure onto `spring`. The failure mode is not about
 * blue.)
 *
 * WHAT KEEPS THE TWO CHANNELS APART IS POSITION, AND IT IS LOAD-BEARING. The state dyes
 * hold an exclusive claim to the state POSITIONS — the warp thread, the status chip, the
 * state dot — and an identity hue may never appear in one. That is not tidiness: under
 * simulated colour-vision deficiency this eight-hue set collapses — azure/violet are 0.0 ΔE
 * to a protanope (genuinely indistinguishable), cyan/azure are 2.4 ΔE to a tritanope, and
 * rose/orchid are 4.3 ΔE to a tritanope — while the four state dyes stay the most separable
 * set under all three simulations: the state worst case is 10.8 ΔE. A supervisor who
 * cannot tell violet from azure still reads the fleet correctly, because nothing they must
 * act on was ever encoded in the channel that collapsed. `test/theme.test.ts` measures
 * exactly that and fails if identity ever becomes the more robust of the two.

/**
 * §The per-CLI hues — program name → the pigment that says *which CLI this pane runs*.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. Before this table every agent pane in the app was the same
 * violet: the mark took the `fleet` icon role's dye (`--id-violet`, "the agents
 * themselves"), which is the correct answer to *is this an agent?* and no answer at all to
 * *which one?* — the question the mark was added to answer (#992). A wall of ten panes
 * running three different CLIs came out one colour, so the glyph had to be read rather than
 * seen, which is exactly what the mark exists to avoid.
 *
 * WHY IT COULD NOT REUSE `--id-*`, WHICH IS THE ONLY INTERESTING DECISION HERE. The eight
 * identity hues are in BIJECTION with the eight icon roles — each hue claimed by exactly one
 * role, enforced in both directions by test/icons.test.ts, and that bijection is what stops
 * eight hues from decaying into a palette of nice colours. Handing `--id-jade` to opencode
 * would not add a meaning, it would give jade a SECOND one, and "jade" would stop resolving
 * to `content` — the failure the bijection was written to prevent. So a per-CLI hue needs a
 * pigment no icon role has claimed, which means a new set, which means a new prefix. That
 * prefix is also the reviewable signal: `--cli-*` in a diff says "this surface is answering
 * *which program*", the same way `--state-*` vs `--id-*` already declares state vs identity.
 *
 * THEY ARE STILL THE IDENTITY CHANNEL, NOT A FOURTH ONE. "Which CLI is this" is the
 * identity question by definition (design note, §The three colour channels, which already
 * lists "per-CLI marks" as an identity consumer). `--cli-*` is a SUB-TABLE of that channel
 * for one closed roster, not a new channel with new rules: an identity hue may still never
 * enter a state position, and neither may one of these.
 *
 * WHY EIGHT MORE PIGMENTS DOES NOT BREAK "EIGHT IS A MEASUREMENT". That ceiling was measured
 * for hues that must be told apart ACROSS THE WHOLE APP — a ninth would have landed closer to
 * an existing hue than the eight-set's own closest pair (azure/violet, 15.3 ΔE). These eight
 * never have to survive that comparison, because they only ever appear in ONE position
 * against each other: the agent mark and the session list's CLI chip. Measured on their own
 * terms they are legible — closest pair 31.5 ΔE (codex/opencode) — and test/theme.test.ts
 * holds them to a floor derived from the eight rather than hard-coded.
 *
 * THAT COMPARISON REVERSED AT #1320, and the argument has to be restated rather than have its
 * number swapped. It used to read "tighter than the eight's own 30.4", which was a licence:
 * seven extra pigments were justified BECAUSE they were the more legible set. De-exoticising
 * the octet dropped its closest pair to 15.3, so the CLI set is now the LOOSER comparison —
 * 31.5 clears 15.3 with room, but it clears it the way any adequate set clears a lowered bar,
 * not by being exemplary. What still justifies the eight is the narrower claim underneath:
 * they answer one closed question in two positions and never have to be told apart from the
 * identity octet, only from each other. If a future round tightens that octet back up, this
 * paragraph is the one to re-derive. (#2126 added pi WITHOUT moving 31.5: its nearest
 * neighbours are codex at 31.7 and copilot at 32.2, so codex/opencode is still the pair this
 * number names.)
 *
 * COLOUR-VISION DEFICIENCY, HONESTLY — AND THE WORST CASE IS TRITAN, NOT THE RED-GREEN ONES.
 * Eight hues on one ground do not survive CVD and these do not. Closest pair per simulation:
 * protan copilot/pi 14.2, deutan copilot/pi 8.6, and tritan codex/copilot **1.4** —
 * which is the honest headline, because a tritanope sees those two as one colour. (Every
 * figure here and below is CIE76 over the Viénot LMS simulation in test/theme.test.ts; that
 * is the only method quoted anywhere in this feature, so two surfaces cannot disagree by
 * having measured differently.)
 *
 * The protan and deutan rows are pi's arrival, not a regression it caused: before it they
 * read opencode/ante 15.6 and codex/hermes 9.5, and pi merely takes over both by a little.
 * Neither is a collapse, and copilot/pi is the safest shape pairing on the roster — the
 * vendored octicon against a letter P.
 *
 * That collapse is the same trade the identity channel already makes and states — state dyes
 * stay separable, identity does not have to, because identity is also carried by position,
 * label and SHAPE. Here the shape is usually one letter, so the trade holds only while no two
 * CLIs draw the same one; where they do, colour is the last channel and has to survive what
 * the others are excused from. Today that is exactly one pair — claude and codex both badge
 * `C` — and its worst view is 25.1 ΔE (protan; deutan 42.2, tritan 135.4). Every pair that
 * DOES collapse is shape-distinct: codex/copilot is a `C` against the vendored octicon,
 * copilot/pi (8.6 deutan) the octicon against a `P`. test/theme.test.ts computes the collision
 * set from the renderer rather than hard-coding it, so a further CLI starting with `C`
 * inherits the obligation automatically.
 *
 * Keys are program names as `normalizeAgentProgram` spells them, which is what lets
 * src/agenticons.ts stamp `cli-<program>` without a second table to keep in step;
 * test/agenticons.test.ts pins the two lists against each other in both directions.

 * meaning, it would give azure a second one. So a per-level hue needs a pigment no icon
 * role and no CLI has claimed, which means a new set and a new prefix — and `--kind-*` in
 * a diff says "this surface is answering *which level*", the way `--cli-*` and `--state-*`
 * already declare theirs.
 *
 * STILL THE IDENTITY CHANNEL. "Which level is this row" is an identity question by
 * definition, so `--kind-*` is a SUB-TABLE of that channel for one closed roster, exactly
 * as `--cli-*` is — not a fourth channel with new rules. An identity hue may never enter a
 * state position, and neither may one of these. That is not an abstract promise here: the
 * board row's LEFT ACCENT is a state position (`--state-attention` for a row waiting on the
 * human, the working dye for an active one), which is why the level is painted as its own
 * mark beside the id and never as that accent. #3261's acceptance criterion offers "a left
 * accent stripe and/or a tinted kind chip"; only the chip is available, and this is why.
 *
 * WHY AN UNLABELLED ROW IS ACHROMATIC. It takes `mist400`, the faint-meta ink — not a fifth
 * hue. A row with no `kind` is not a fifth level, it is a row on the flat board, exempt from
 * the ladder entirely (see the MCP `upsert_task` description), and giving it a pigment would
 * say it had a place on a ladder it is deliberately off. It is the `stateHeld`/`stateIdle`
 * argument applied here: a thing that carries no level carries no dye. It is also the one
 * entry that never paints TEXT — mist400 is below AA by design — so it renders as a hollow
 * mark only, and test/theme.test.ts holds the four levels and this one to different floors
 * for that reason.
 *
 * COLOUR-VISION DEFICIENCY, MEASURED. Unlike the CLI octet, this set does not collapse:
 * worst pair over all five marks is protan 12.8 ΔE, deutan 15.9, tritan 10.0 (figures and
 * method in the PALETTE comment above, re-derived rather than remembered by
 * test/theme.test.ts). Four hues can hold a floor eight cannot, and the ladder is also
 * carried by the row's indent and by the chip's own word when the row is open — colour is
 * the scanning channel here, never the only one.
 *
 * Keys are `TASK_KINDS` as the backend spells them, plus `UNLABELLED_KIND` as
 * `src/taskboard.ts` spells it; test/taskkind.test.ts pins the two lists against each other
 * in both directions, the way test/agenticons.test.ts does for the CLI table.
