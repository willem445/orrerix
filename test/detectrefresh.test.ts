// A detection reply refreshes every surface it invalidates — on BOTH hosts, by
// BOTH routes (#993, #997 review blocking 1, reshaped by #1020).
//
// STRUCTURAL, and read off the source tree on purpose. This is DOM-wiring, and
// this repo validates DOM wiring by hand rather than by simulating a DOM
// (CLAUDE.md, code conventions) — so the thing that went wrong here cannot be
// reached by a behavioural test at all. What went wrong was a *missing call*:
// the workflow block editor repainted the model dropdown and nothing else,
// while its sibling reply handler four hundred lines up re-ran the analysis pass
// and repainted the knob rows. The data was fresh the whole time; the DOM was
// stale.
//
// The failure that produces is not cosmetic. `knobLookup` answers differently
// once a reply lands, so the Thinking-level row goes on offering `xhigh` for a
// model whose reply says it has no effort setting — the human picks it, the next
// mutation re-renders the row disabled, and the findings pane flags the block.
// The editor offered a value its own validator rejects, which is the exact thing
// workflow pane's own comments claim cannot happen.
//
// **What #1020 changed about the subject, and what it did not.** The reply used
// to arrive from an `onDetect:` button hook; the button is gone, and a reply now
// arrives on two routes instead — the LOOKUP a picker fires when it paints, and
// the PUSH from the backend's startup sweep (`modelCatalog.onReport`). The
// refresh each one owes is identical, so each host funnels both into ONE
// method, and this file's job moved accordingly: it pins that the funnel exists,
// that it does the work, and that the routes reach it.
//
// It also pins something the button architecture did not need: the lookup fires
// from a RENDER path, and its own refresh ends in a re-render, so an unguarded
// handler is an infinite loop rather than a stale row. See the re-entry test.
//
// So this is a source scan, in the tradition of `transport.test.ts`'s
// one-module-imports-@tauri-apps rule and `tests/groupid.rs`'s two scans: the
// property is "this handler reaches these refreshers", the next one will be
// written by copy-paste from a neighbour rather than by reading the rule, and a
// scan is what notices.
//
// **What this instrument does NOT do**, stated here rather than left for a
// reader to discover, the way `groupid.rs`'s scans enumerate their own blind
// spots:
//
//   - It asserts REACHABILITY BY NAME, not behaviour. A handler that calls
//     `renderFindings()` on a path that never runs still passes.
//   - **NOTHING in this file is a behaviour test, including the
//     `runWhenNotEditing` pins at the bottom.** Those are source scans of a
//     second file, one level down. A behaviour pin genuinely is not available:
//     the method reads `document.activeElement` and attaches a listener, and
//     this repo forbids simulating a DOM (CLAUDE.md), so whether a deferral
//     actually defers is hand-validated like the rest of the DOM wiring. An
//     earlier version of this header said the opposite and it was never true
//     (#997 review B-1).
//   - It reads the SOURCE, not the module graph, so a refresher reached through
//     an indirection it cannot see reads as absent. That is the safe direction:
//     it under-recognises rather than over-claiming — but only because FULL-LINE
//     comments are stripped first. A trailing comment after code is NOT
//     stripped and could still satisfy an assertion; that is an accepted
//     residual (stripping those safely needs a tokenizer, not a regex).
//     Before this scan stripped anything, prose in a full-line comment satisfied
//     the assertions too, which made this exact sentence false outright
//     (#997 review B-2). See `stripComments`.
//   - The re-entry guard is checked in a WINDOW of source before the call, not
//     by parsing the enclosing `if`. A guard written far above its call, or
//     spelled through a helper, reads as absent. Safe direction again, and the
//     window is generous enough for a comment-free rewrite.
//
// It covers EVERY call site in each file, not just the first (#997 review
// NB-4). There is one per host today, so first-only would be sound as written —
// which is exactly why it is worth not doing: a second picker would go
// unchecked while the suite stayed green, and a scan that silently covers a
// subset is worse than no scan, because it reads as coverage.
//
// The vacuity guards below are load-bearing, not decoration: they fail if the
// region this thinks it is scanning stops being one. They caught two bugs in the
// scanner itself before this file was correct.
//
// **Every limit above was found by somebody mutating this file's subject and
// watching it stay green.** That is the only way a structural test's claims get
// checked, and it is the standard this file is held to precisely because it
// reads as broader coverage than it has.
