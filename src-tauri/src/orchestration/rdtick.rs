//! The review-loop driver's registry wiring (#1778 S3).
//!
//! Design note: `doc/design/review-driver.md`. Every decision this file makes
//! is made somewhere else: the state machine is [`reviewdrive::decide`], the
//! gate is [`mergeq::recheck_gate`], the `gh` reads and the notice text are
//! [`rddrive`]. What lives here is what only the registry can do — resolve the
//! policy, the gate and the verdict files, hold the state lock across the
//! read-modify-write, perform the spawns and resumes, emit the audit events,
//! and deliver the notices.
//!
//! # Why its own file rather than more of `mod.rs`
//!
//! Size is the smaller reason. The larger one is that §3.1 item 1's source
//! scan needs a scope, and CLAUDE.md's source-scanning-guard convention
//! forbids deciding one from a binding's NAME — the design note says so about
//! this scan in particular: "any scope keyed on a name — a module, an `rd_*`
//! prefix — is stepped over by a landing verb added in a function that does
//! not carry it". A **file** is not a name. Every landing verb the driver
//! could reach has to be written down somewhere, and this is the somewhere, so
//! `tests/reviewdrive.rs` can default-deny the whole of it and a rename cannot
//! move code out from under the guard.
//!
//! The residual is stated where the scan is implemented, not here, and it is
//! the one the note names: a landing verb the driver reaches through a SHARED
//! helper it does not own. [`rddrive::RdRunner`] closes the `git` half of that
//! structurally — it has no `git` method — and nothing closes the `gh` half but
//! the scan.

        // head rather than on the full (head, digest) key; the two changes ship
        // together for that reason, and refusing without the re-key would swap a
        // duplicate reviewer for a hold hours away that names no lane.
        //
        // A lane that HAS answered here and whose pane then went busy on
        // something else — a human re-tasking it, another drive taking it over —
        // is the residual: the stall arm exempts it precisely because it
        // answered. An earlier version of this comment claimed that case could
        // not arise ("a pane still holding the round has by definition recorded
        // no verdict for it"), and that premise is false — answering and then
        // being given other work are not exclusive.
        //
        // **What bounds it moved in #2110, and only what bounds it.** That
        // issue built no per-lane refusal clock, so there is still nothing
        // per-lane here and the hold still names no lane; what it added is a
        // per-STATE bound, and `review-wait` is a state, so this composition
        // now leaves at its `review-wait` state bound as `held(state-stalled)`
        // rather than at twelve hours as `held(drive-stalled)` — four hours on a
        // one-lane gate at stock knobs, since #2117 review 2 made that bound the
        // constant PLUS one `lane_timeout_minutes` per required lane.
        // `an_answered_lane_whose_re_brief_is_refused_is_bounded_by_the_review_wait_state_bound`
        // pins the gap and that exit; closing it properly still wants the
        // per-lane clock.
        //
        // **#2162 narrowed this refusal and left that residual where it is.** A
        // pane the reuse arm DECLINED is idle by construction, and refusing a
        // replacement for it deadlocked the drive — so `rd_live_lane_pane` now
        // refuses only a pane that is still WORKING. The residual above is the

        // release is still `status != Dead` and still counted. At the cap the
        // spawn is refused, the arm parks the drive `held(cap-refused)` on a
        // notice asking an orchestrator to free a slot, and only then would the
        // release free one. A parked drive does not self-advance, so that is an
        // orchestrator wake — the exact cost #2501 measured, reintroduced by
        // #2501's own worker rule. Releasing first means `mark_dead` has already
        // dropped the pane out of `live_delegate_count` before `rd_spawn` asks.
        //
        // Nothing else depends on the old order. The candidates were computed
        // pre-arc either way (see `releasable` above); reading each pane id here
        // reads the record BEFORE `rd_open_lane` could replace it, which is
        // strictly safer than after; and the exit notices are still built below
        // the whole `match`, off `entry.owned_panes()`, so they name what is
        // actually left. The one thing that moves is the ordering against
        // `entry.take`: a transition `take` refuses (unreachable through
        // `decide`) would now follow a release rather than skip it, which is
        // still correct — a lane that answered at this head is finished with
        // this round whether or not the drive managed to move.
        //
        // Three things happen per candidate, in this order and for these
        // reasons.
        //
        // **The session is resolved FIRST**, through `rd_lane_session`'s three
        // sources, and an empty answer skips the candidate. The promise this
        // whole mechanism rests on is that the conversation survives, and a lane
        // whose session cannot be named is one whose conversation the kill would
        // end. Failing closed here costs a slot; failing open costs the review.
        //
        // **Then the kill**, through the one capability the driver has for it.
        // `release_driven_pane` is the barrier — idle, alive, bound to a
        // terminal, not a manager — and it answers `Err` for every pane that is
        // none of those, which is skipped rather than recorded.
        //
        // **Then the record**, and only on the kill having succeeded. The two
        // are under ONE hold of `rd_state_lock`, which is what keeps the pane
        // from ever being live and unowned: `mark_dead` has already made
        // `resolve_token` refuse that caller by the time its id leaves the
        // record, so §7 has no window to leak through. Doing the kill out in the
        // caller's side-effect loop, the way a kick-back delivery is done, would
        // open exactly that window — and a delivery is safe there because losing
        // one costs a line, while losing this ordering costs an unowned pane.
        //
        // The audit row is written last, on the fact rather than the intent:
