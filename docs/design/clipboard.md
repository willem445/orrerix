# Design: reliable copy & paste

Status: implemented (issue #65, extended by #370).

## Problem

Two clipboard symptoms in terminal panes:

- **Copy silently fails.** An agent CLI (e.g. claude code) prints "copied!" but
  the system clipboard is unchanged.
- **Paste lags or doesn't land.** Pasting into a pane sometimes drops input or
  leaves the target app in a stuck state.

Both were root-caused before fixing.

## Copy: OSC 52 was never wired

A CLI copies to the *system* clipboard by emitting an OSC 52 escape:

```
ESC ] 52 ; <Pc> ; <Pd> BEL
```

`<Pc>` selects the clipboard (`c` = clipboard, `p` = primary, …) and `<Pd>` is
the base64 of the UTF-8 text. **xterm.js does not implement OSC 52.** It only
exposes `parser.registerOscHandler(52, …)`; with no handler registered the
sequence is parsed and discarded. So the CLI's own "copied!" message is
optimistic — nothing ever reached the OS clipboard.

The pane already registered an OSC 7 handler (cwd reporting) but none for 52.

### Fix

`src/clipboard.ts` parses the payload (`parseOsc52`, pure/DOM-free and unit
tested) and `pane.ts` registers a handler that writes the decoded text via
`writeClipboard` (async Clipboard API, with a hidden-`textarea` +
`execCommand` fallback, mirroring gitview's `copyText`).

Read requests (`ESC]52;c;?BEL`) are **ignored on purpose**: servicing one would
leak the clipboard to any process that asks and require writing a reply back
into the PTY. We only ever *write*.

Two hardening guards (review of #68):

- **Size cap before decode.** `parseOsc52` rejects a payload longer than
  `OSC52_MAX_B64_LEN` (1 MiB of base64) *before* calling `atob`, so a hostile or
  buggy CLI can't make us balloon a giant string on the main thread. An oversize
  payload is distinguished from a benign ignore (`{ok:false, reason:"oversize"}`)
  so the pane can toast it.
- **No silent copy failure.** `writeClipboard` returns whether the write
  actually succeeded; the pane toasts ("Copy failed — click the pane and try
  again") when both the async API *and* the `execCommand` fallback fail. Without
  this a locked-down webview would silently no-op and reintroduce the exact
  "said copied, clipboard empty" symptom with no signal.

Why not the Tauri clipboard plugin? It pulls in `arboard`, which drags a
`getrandom` dependency (banned on this project's Windows 10 baseline — it
imports `ProcessPrng`, failing to load with `0xc0000139`) plus a large
image-clipboard tree. The frontend Clipboard API is dependency-free,
cross-platform (CI runs Linux/macOS/Windows), and matches the existing copy
path. The webview grants clipboard-write to the focused terminal, which is the
state OSC 52 fires in.

## Paste: unordered fire-and-forget IPC writes

Input flowed to the PTY as:

```ts
term.onData((data) => writePty(id, data).catch(() => {}));
```

Every `writePty` is an async Tauri `invoke` that crosses the IPC boundary as an
independent task. Firing them without awaiting lets the backend receive them
**out of order** — each command acquires the per-pty writer lock in
nondeterministic order. A keystroke can overtake a paste, or, worst case, a
bracketed-paste terminator `ESC[201~` can land *before* its body: the target
app stays in paste mode and swallows everything typed next. That is the
"paste lags / doesn't land" report.

### Fix

`src/ptywrite.ts` provides `createOrderedWriter` (pure, unit tested). It
serializes writes into a promise chain so **exactly one `invoke` is in flight
at a time** — the IPC layer therefore receives bytes in xterm's original order
and cannot reorder them. It also:

- buffers input produced before the PTY exists and flushes it in order once
  ready (subsuming the old ad-hoc `inputQueue`);
- splits very large pastes into bounded (16 KiB) chunks via `chunkForPty`, so a
  single multi-megabyte write can't stall ConPTY's small input pipe, and never
  slices a UTF-16 surrogate pair.

`pane.ts` routes all `onData` through the writer and binds it to the PTY id on
spawn.

## Testing

- `test/clipboard.test.ts` — OSC 52 parsing: ASCII + UTF-8 round-trip, empty
  `Pc`, read-request/empty/malformed rejection.
- `test/ptywrite.test.ts` — FIFO ordering when an early send resolves last,
  pre-ready buffering, failure isolation, and `chunkForPty` bounds / surrogate
  safety / exact rejoin.

The interactive halves (does the OS clipboard actually change; does a real
paste into a bracketed-paste CLI land) are covered by the manual repro matrix
in the PR.

## #370: paste was Ctrl+Shift+V-only, and read failures were swallowed

Two follow-on symptoms, both in the terminal's keydown handler (not the OSC 52
path above, which was already sound):

- **Plain `Ctrl+V` did nothing.** The handler matched only
  `ctrlKey && shiftKey && KeyV` (Windows Terminal convention — plain `Ctrl+V`
  is traditionally a shell's readline "quoted insert next char"). Muscle
  memory reaches for plain `Ctrl+V` first; getting silence read as "paste is
  broken here."
- **A blocked clipboard read was silent.**
  `navigator.clipboard.readText().then(...).catch(() => {})` — a rejected read
  (focus loss, permission, non-secure context) looked identical to a keypress
  that did nothing. The copy side already had a toast for this (#65); paste
  didn't.

### Fix

`src/pasteflow.ts` (DOM-free, unit tested) decides the gestures: `isPasteKey`
matches `Ctrl+Shift+V` unconditionally (the original binding, kept) and plain
`Ctrl+V` **only when the `pasteOnPlainCtrlV` setting allows it** (default on
— see "The plain-Ctrl+V tradeoff, and the setting" below). `isCopyKey` is
unchanged — `Ctrl+Shift+C` only, since plain `Ctrl+C` must stay SIGINT.
`isPasteKey` also refuses to match with Alt held (`e.altKey`), guarding
against a keyboard-layout collision: on layouts where AltGr (= Ctrl+Alt) + V
types a character, an unguarded plain-Ctrl+V match would eat `Ctrl+Alt+V` as
a paste instead of letting that character reach the shell.

`src/clipboard.ts` gained `readClipboard()`, the paste-side mirror of
`writeClipboard`: async Clipboard API first, a hidden-`textarea` +
`execCommand("paste")` fallback second, and an explicit `{ok: false}` only
when *both* fail — never swallowed. `pane.ts`'s `pasteFromClipboard()` surfaces
that with the same toast convention `copyToClipboard` already uses. An empty
clipboard (`ok: true, text: ""`) is not a failure — it's a legitimate no-op.

A right-click Copy/Paste context menu briefly lived here too — see "Right-
click menu: tried, then removed" below for why it didn't survive.

### The plain-Ctrl+V tradeoff, and the setting

The first version of this fix bound plain `Ctrl+V` to paste **unconditionally**
and named only readline's quoted-insert as the cost — understating it. Review
caught the real casualty: **vim/nvim's `Ctrl+V` enters VISUAL BLOCK mode**, one
of vim's everyday, signature motions, and vim/nvim users are exactly the kind
of power user a terminal multiplexer's audience skews toward. The same holds
for any other TUI or agent CLI running in the pane that binds plain `Ctrl+V`
itself — readline's quoted-insert is the least of what an unconditional
interception costs.

The review also caught an overstated justification: "every terminal emulator
already binds plain `Ctrl+V`" is not true. Windows Terminal does, by default —
but gnome-terminal, iTerm2, kitty, and alacritty all default to
`Ctrl+Shift+V` specifically to leave plain `Ctrl+V` free for whatever is
running in the pane.

This is the exact shape of tradeoff `shortcuts.ts` already made a call on for
`Alt+V` (#155): loomux used to intercept it, discovered it was Claude Code's
own paste-image binding, and **stopped intercepting** rather than keep
stealing a key an agent pane needed. Plain `Ctrl+V` is the same failure mode —
a multiplexer-level binding shadowing a key the program *inside* the pane
wants — so it gets the same resolution in spirit: don't force the choice on
everyone, offer it.

**`src/settings.ts`** adds `pasteOnPlainCtrlV: boolean` (default `true`) as
loomux's first durable app setting, persisted the same way the tab set already
is — a sibling `settings.json` written through two new backend commands
(`load_settings`/`save_settings`, `uistate.rs`) that reuse the *exact same*
atomic-write + corrupt-quarantine primitives `load_ui_tabs`/`save_ui_tabs`
already use, not a new storage mechanism. `main.ts` loads it once at boot;
`pane.ts`'s keydown handler reads it synchronously via `settings.getSettings()`
on every keystroke (a settings object can't be threaded through
`attachCustomKeyEventHandler`'s synchronous callback any other way).

There is **no Settings/Preferences UI anywhere in loomux today** — checked
before choosing this shape, so this isn't a fallback taken to avoid building
one. The setting is config-file-only: on first run (or after a corrupt file
is quarantined) loomux seeds `settings.json` with the defaults, so the file
exists to be found and hand-edited; there is no live reload, so a change takes
effect on the next launch. `Ctrl+Shift+V` pastes unconditionally either way —
turning the setting off only returns plain `Ctrl+V` to the pane, exactly the
pre-#370 behavior for that one key.

### The double-paste bug (#402 live-demo round 2, findings 1 + 2)

A human running a real dev build (not covered by the pure test suites at
all) found plain `Ctrl+V` pasting the clipboard **twice**, and right-clicking
an agent pane both opening the (then-still-present) Copy/Paste menu *and*
pasting immediately.

**Root cause, both bugs, one mechanism.** `@xterm/xterm` binds its own,
independent `"paste"` DOM event listener directly on its internal textarea
and root element (`handlePasteEvent`, xterm's own input-handler module) — a
completely separate path from anything in `pasteflow.ts`/`pane.ts`. Whenever
the *browser* fires a native `paste` event on that textarea, xterm pastes
into the terminal itself, independent of and in addition to loomux's own
`readClipboard()`-driven paste.

- **Plain Ctrl+V:** the original fix returned `false` from
  `attachCustomKeyEventHandler` on a match, which per xterm's own contract
  only means "don't let xterm's key handling process this" — it does **not**
  call `preventDefault()` on the underlying `KeyboardEvent`. Without that, the
  browser's own native Ctrl+V accelerator still fires on xterm's focused
  textarea, which dispatches the native `paste` event xterm listens for —
  landing the clipboard text a second time. `Ctrl+Shift+V` had the identical
  gap the whole time (pre-dating this PR) but never manifested, because
  `Ctrl+Shift+V` isn't a browser-native paste accelerator — nothing native
  ever fired for it. Fix: `keyDisposition` (see its own doc comment,
  pasteflow.ts) collapses the copy/paste decision into one enum so the DOM
  layer's `preventDefault()` calls in pane.ts can't be added for one branch
  and forgotten for the other.
- **Right-click:** xterm's `contextmenu` listener (bound on its own root
  element, a descendant of `pane.ts`'s `termEl`) does not itself paste — it
  only repositions its hidden textarea and pre-selects text for a native
  Copy. But *some* browser-native path (right-click's own default handling in
  the webview, independent of the `contextmenu` event our own listener
  already `preventDefault()`s) still ends up dispatching that same native
  `paste` event xterm listens for. `preventDefault()` on `contextmenu` stops
  the native *context menu*; it does nothing about a native `paste` event
  triggered by a different code path.

**Fix, for both:** `pane.ts` adds a capture-phase `"paste"` listener directly
on `termEl` that unconditionally calls `preventDefault()`/`stopPropagation()`.
Capture phase means it runs *before* the event ever reaches xterm's own
listener (bound to a descendant, in the bubble phase), so it kills the native
path regardless of what triggered it — the Ctrl+V accelerator, the right-click
gesture, or anything else the webview might do. This can never block a paste
loomux *intends*: our own paste path is `this.term.paste(text)`, a direct
method call on xterm's public API that never dispatches a DOM `paste` event
at all. Combined with the keydown handler's now-explicit `preventDefault()`,
loomux owns paste entirely — xterm's native path never fires.

### Right-click menu: tried, then removed (#402 live-demo round 3)

The right-click Copy/Paste menu (`pasteflow.ts`'s `buildTerminalMenu`,
rendered through the shared `contextmenu.ts`) was added to give the terminal
a discoverable paste affordance no other pane kind needed (a native
`<textarea>`/`<input>` gets a right-click Copy/Paste menu from the browser
for free; the terminal is a canvas and had nothing). The capture-phase native-
`"paste"` kill switch above fixed the *double*-paste half of the right-click
bug, but a further live-demo round found the menu's own paste path still
unreliable in practice, and the human decided not to keep debugging a second
right-click-specific native-event interaction — the menu was removed rather
than iterated on further.

Right-click on a terminal is now back to its pre-#370 behavior: nothing. The
global `.pane-term` `contextmenu` `preventDefault()` in `main.ts` (which
predates this PR) still suppresses the browser's own native menu, so a
right-click is silently absorbed rather than doing anything — the same as
before this issue was ever filed. Copy remains available via the keydown
path (below), unaffected by the menu's removal — it was never routed through
the menu. `pasteflow.ts` keeps only the keydown gesture logic
(`isPasteKey`/`isCopyKey`/`isConditionalCopyKey`/`keyDisposition`) — no
menu-shape code remains.

### Plain Ctrl+C copies too, conditionally (#402 live-demo round 4)

A further live-demo round reported copy "working in agent panes but not
plain terminal panes." Reading the code end to end shows there is, and was,
no pane-kind branch anywhere in this path — `pane.ts`'s keydown handler and
`pasteflow.ts`'s `keyDisposition` are exactly one function each, called
identically for a plain terminal pane, an agent pane, or an orchestrator
pane. The most plausible reading of the report: an agent CLI (e.g. Claude
Code) can have its own internal copy affordance over OSC 52 for content
*it* selects through its own TUI — a mechanism entirely separate from xterm's
mouse-drag text selection and loomux's Ctrl+Shift+C binding — which reads as
"copy works here" while a plain shell, with no such CLI-level feature, only
had the explicit `Ctrl+Shift+C` gesture. Most users reach for plain `Ctrl+C`
first (the universal outside-a-terminal convention: select, then Ctrl+C), and
that combo previously did nothing but send `^C` — so a mouse-selected region
in a plain pane felt uncopiable even though the mechanism (`Ctrl+Shift+C`)
was there the whole time.

**Fix:** `isConditionalCopyKey` matches plain `Ctrl+C` (excluding
`Ctrl+Shift+C`, which `isCopyKey` already owns, and excluding Alt, mirroring
the paste-side AltGr guard). `keyDisposition` now takes a third parameter,
`hasSelection` — DOM/xterm runtime state (`term.getSelection()`), not
something derivable from the `KeyboardEvent` alone, so `pane.ts` reads it
once per keydown and passes it in, the same discipline `plainCtrlVPastes`
already uses for `settings.ts`'s live value:

- Plain `Ctrl+C` **with** a selection → `"copy"` (and the selection is
  cleared afterward, so the highlight doesn't linger once you keep typing).
- Plain `Ctrl+C` **without** a selection → `"pass"` — **unconditionally**,
  since plain Ctrl+C is the terminal's actual interrupt key. This is the
  constraint the whole feature exists to protect: SIGINT must always be
  reachable from the keyboard, with or without something happening to be
  selected at the time.
- `Ctrl+Shift+C` is unchanged: always intercepted, copies with a selection,
  a harmless no-op without one — it was never the interrupt key, so eating
  it unconditionally was always safe and stays that way.

No pane-kind parameter was added anywhere — `keyDisposition` still only
takes `(event, plainCtrlVPastes, hasSelection)`. `test/pasteflow.test.ts`'s
pane-kind/selection matrix pins this directly: a "plain terminal pane" input
and an "agent pane" input, built identically, are required to produce the
identical disposition, proving there is no divergence left to reintroduce.

### WebView2 clipboard permission: dev vs. packaged

Live-testing (`npm run tauri dev`, origin `http://localhost:1420`) surfaced a
WebView2 clipboard-permission prompt on first paste — the dev server's origin
is a plain HTTP origin, which WebView2 treats like any other web page and
gates the async Clipboard API behind a runtime permission prompt. The
**packaged app loads from its own custom app origin**
(`http://tauri.localhost` on Windows — see `tests/acl_manifest.rs`'s
`LOCAL_ORIGIN_URL`), which does not go through that same runtime
permission-prompt flow. This is a dev-environment-only wrinkle, not a bug: a
denied/blocked read (in either environment) already falls through
`readClipboard`'s `execCommand` fallback and, if that fails too, surfaces the
honest "Paste failed" toast (pane.ts) — never a silent no-op.

### Testing

- `test/pasteflow.test.ts` — key matching (`Ctrl+Shift+V` always pastes;
  plain `Ctrl+V` pastes only when the setting says so; `Ctrl+Alt+V`/AltGr is
  never a paste), `isCopyKey`/`isConditionalCopyKey`'s split (explicit vs.
  selection-gated copy), `keyDisposition`'s copy/paste/pass enum across every
  `(event, setting, selection)` combination, and a pane-kind/selection matrix
  that pins a "plain terminal pane" and an "agent pane" — built from
  identical inputs — to the identical disposition, proving there is no
  pane-kind branch anywhere in this path.
- `test/settings.test.ts` — `encodeSettings`/`decodeSettings` round-trip,
  first-run/corrupt-file `null` handling, and per-key fallback so a partial or
  future-versioned hand-edit degrades gracefully instead of losing the file.
- DOM wiring (the keydown handler, the capture-phase native-paste kill
  switch, the toast, `clearSelection()` after a copy) and the settings
  load/seed-on-first-run are hand-validated — see the PR body for the manual
  steps. The double-paste, right-click-paste, menu-unreliability, and
  plain-Ctrl+C-doesn't-copy findings are exactly the class of defect the pure
  suites structurally cannot see (no DOM event dispatch, no xterm instance,
  no real selection state) — they surfaced only across four rounds of a real
  dev-build live demo.
