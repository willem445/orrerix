// self-contained feature gets its own wrapper module, and no other frontend module
// calls `invoke` for these commands (docs/design/architecture.md's "Extension seams"
// names this as the sanctioned alternative to piling everything into `pty.ts`).
//
// Every command takes the pane's `root` plus a `rel` path relative to it. ALL path
// safety is enforced server-side (filemgr.rs): containment, the refusal to act on
// the root itself, and the name rules. The mirror checks in `fileexplorermodel.ts`
// exist to answer the user WHILE THEY TYPE — they are a courtesy, never the
// boundary.
