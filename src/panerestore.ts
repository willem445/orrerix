// Pure per-pane restore policy for session restore (#194). DOM-free so the
// hybrid decision (below) is unit-tested (test/panerestore.test.ts); the actual
// grid rebuild — feeding these actions to grid.openPane / resumeOrchSession —
// is main.ts wiring (Phase 4).
//
// THE ADOPTED HYBRID (issue #194, plan comment). Resuming a CLI session re-opens
// its context but costs NOTHING until a prompt is sent, so:
//
//   - Terminal  → re-spawn a fresh shell in the recorded cwd + shell kind. No
//                 session to resume; zero cost; layout/cwd back instantly.
//   - Agent     → AUTO-RESUME via the recorded session id (--resume into the idle
//                 TUI): loads context, spends no credits, delivers "near-exact
//                 state". NEVER replays a queued prompt. With no resumable id
//                 (best-effort CLIs) it falls back to a DORMANT pane with a Start
//                 button in the same cwd.
//   - Orch      → NEVER auto-resumed. An orchestration pane (orchestrator /
//                 worker / reviewer) restores DORMANT; the human resumes the
//                 whole group via the existing resumeOrchSession path. This is
//                 the ONE place a resume can actually burn credits — a resumed
//                 autonomous orchestrator (#83) may idle-tick and spawn a worker
//                 storm (#78) — so the credit-safety stance stays exactly here.
//   - SSH       → NEVER auto-reconnected (#887 S4). An ssh pane restores DORMANT
//                 with a Reconnect button, for two reasons that do not overlap:
//                 the far end is an agent CLI on someone else's machine, so an
//                 automatic reconnect spends REMOTE credits with no human present
//                 (the orch-pane argument, one host removed); and a host that is
//                 down, asleep, or behind a VPN that isn't up yet turns boot into
//                 a wait on a TCP connect that may not fail for a minute. Neither
//                 applies to a local shell, which is why "terminal" still comes
//                 straight back. Reconnect rebuilds the command from the SAVED
//                 PROFILE (not a captured argv — see PersistedPane.sshProfileId),
//                 resuming the remote session when one was recorded.
//   - Content   → re-open the pane at its recorded root: the file MANAGER (#214),
//                 the file EDITOR, the GIT view (#217), or the WORKFLOW pane (#222).
//                 No process, no session,
//                 nothing to resume — they're pure content, so they come straight
//                 back. Whether the root still exists (and, for git, is still a
//                 repo) is I/O, which this pure module can't do: each action carries
//                 the recorded root (possibly null) and the caller fails soft to the
//                 welcome form in that slot when the probe says no.
//
// Flip AUTO_RESUME_AGENTS to false to make EVERY agent restore dormant instead —
// the plan's promised one-line switch, kept literally one line here.

 *  excision beside `stripSessionFlagsFrom*`.
 *
 *  Its own vocabulary, verbatim from `codex resume --help` at 0.153.4:
 *
 *      Usage: codex resume [OPTIONS] [SESSION_ID] [PROMPT]
 *        [SESSION_ID]  Session id (UUID) or session name. UUIDs take precedence
 *                      if it parses. If omitted, use --last to pick the most
 *                      recent recorded session
 *        --last        Continue the most recent session without showing the picker
 *
 *  So three shapes have to be recognised, and `--last` is why the middle one
 *  cannot be folded into the general "consume the following value unless it
 *  starts with --" rule the flag excision uses: here a following `--last` IS
 *  part of the resume invocation rather than the next flag.
 *
 *   - `resume <id>` — the form loomux and the Sessions tab both emit;
 *   - `resume --last` — a human's, and a picker-free resume of the newest;
 *   - a bare trailing `resume` — the picker, which loomux never emits but a
 *     human may have typed.
 *
 *  **Residual, and it is peculiar to a bare word.** Every other identity token
 *  this module excises begins with `--`, which prose does not; `resume` does
 *  not, so a codex line carrying an UNQUOTED prompt whose words happen to run
 *  "… resume something" would have those two words removed. loomux never
 *  records such a line — it appends no prompt to any agent command, the
 *  no-replay rule `agentResumeCommand` states — so the exposure is a
 *  hand-typed custom command only, and a quoted prompt is immune by the same
 *  `tokenizeWithPositions` property that protects a quoted `--resume`. */

 *  options that a `--` test counts as a session id — `codex --help` at 0.153.4:
 *  `-c/--config`, `-i/--image`, `-m/--model`, `-p/--profile`, `-s/--sandbox`,
 *  `-C/--cd`, `-a/--ask-for-approval`. Restoring a hand-typed
 *  `codex -C /repo resume -c model=o3 old-id` therefore ATE the `-c`, emitting
 *  `codex -C /repo model=o3 old-id resume new-id`.
 *
 *  `--last` is the one `-`-prefixed token that IS consumed, because it is
 *  `resume`'s own no-id switch rather than a flag with a value.
 *
 *  A quoted token's raw slice starts with `"`, so it is neither a flag nor an
 *  id — the same immunity that protects a quoted `--resume`.
 *
 *  **Residual, narrowed but not closed.** On a hand-typed
 *  `codex resume -c model=o3 old-id` the `resume` token is now dropped ALONE,
 *  leaving `old-id` as a stray root positional — clap rejects the line. That is

/** Turn a resumed agent's recorded launch line into the command that re-opens
 *  its prior session — the "resume/reattach command from a recorded sessionId"
 *  the plan calls for. Pure so it's unit-tested; main.ts feeds the result to
 *  grid.openPane.
 *
 *  This function rewrites a `claude …` OR a `copilot …` line: drop any
 *  recorded `--session-id`/`--resume` (every form `stripSessionFlagsFrom*`
 *  covers) so we never carry a stale id or double the flag, KEEP every other
 *  flag (model, the autopilot permission flag) so the resumed pane matches
 *  how it was launched, then append a fresh `--resume`. Resuming into the
 *  idle TUI costs nothing until a prompt is sent — and we never append one
 *  (the no-replay rule).
 *
 *  Four properties this module holds at once (#449; the last two added on
 *  #471 review round 3, per rev-11's trace through #473/#458's copilot
 *  emission fix — stated explicitly here per that review, not left implicit):
 *   1. Excision (`stripSessionFlagsFrom*`) strips a recorded session flag in
 *      ANY form, for EITHER flag name — see those functions' own docs.
 *   2. **copilot's `--resume` is emitted in the `=` form** (`--resume=<id>`):
 *      per the copilot CLI reference, the space form does not reliably bind.
 *      #473/#458 changed `scan_copilot()` to RECORD `--resume=<id>` for
 *      exactly this reason; without this, restoring that pane through THIS
 *      function would silently rewrite it back to the space form on every
 *      restore — the two PRs' fixes undoing each other, oscillating forever
 *      instead of converging.
 *   3. **copilot's `--session-id` stays SPACE form** — `agentFreshCommand`
 *      below, untouched. Deliberately asymmetric: the copilot CLI reference
 *      documents `--session-id ID` in the space form specifically, so
 *      "making the two flags consistent" would be a plausible-looking
 *      cleanup that quietly breaks a function that is currently correct.
 *      Pinned in `test/panerestore.test.ts` precisely so the next person who
 *      notices the asymmetry finds a test explaining it, not a TODO.
 *   4. A command needing no change comes back byte-identical apart from the
 *      appended flag (#442's guarantee, general to this whole module).
 *   5. **opencode resumes with `--session <id>`, not `--resume`** (#722): it
 *      has no `--resume` flag at all, so the default arm would hand its TUI a
 *      flag it does not know — and a pane opened from the Sessions tab is
 *      recorded with `opencode --session <id>` already, so without this the
 *      very next tab restore would rewrite it to
 *      `opencode --session A --resume A`. Space form, matching the resume arm
 *      of the backend's own `build_agent_command`; its excision uses
 *      `OPENCODE_SESSION_FLAG_NAMES` so the recorded `--session` is dropped
 *      rather than doubled.
 *   6. **pi resumes with `--session-id <id>` — the SAME flag a fresh pi launch
 *      uses** (#2126 P2), which is the one place this module deliberately emits
 *      no difference between the two paths. pi's `--session-id` opens the named
 *      session if it exists and creates it with that id if it does not
 *      (`SOURCE` `main.ts`'s `createSessionManager`:
 *      `findLocalSessionByExactId` … else `SessionManager.create(…, { id })`),
 *      so one flag answers both cases and the pane keeps its identity either
 *      way. That matters because a pi session file does not exist until the
 *      first assistant response: a pane killed before it was ever prompted has
 *      a real, pre-minted id and NO file, and `--session` — which requires an
 *      existing one — would fail on exactly the pane a restore is most likely
 *      to hit. Excision uses `PI_SESSION_FLAG_NAMES` so a `--session` recorded
 *      by the Sessions tab is dropped rather than combined with it, which pi
 *      refuses.
 *   7. **codex resumes with a SUBCOMMAND, `resume <id>`, appended last**
 *      (#2515 C2) — the only CLI here that names a session with no flag at
 *      all. Two consequences the other six arms do not have. Its excision is
 *      `stripCodexResumeFromCommand`, not `stripSessionFlagsFrom*`, because
 *      there is no flag name to match on; and the token must land at the END
 *      of the line rather than anywhere among the flags, because codex's usage
 *      is `codex [OPTIONS] <COMMAND> [ARGS]` and its root options are
 *      inherited by the subcommand rather than the other way round. Every
 *      other recorded flag survives, so a pane keeps the `-C`/`-p`/`-m` it was
 *      launched with — which for codex includes the `-C <cwd>` that stops it
 *      prompting about which directory to resume into.
 *
 *  Prefers the string `command`; falls back to structured `argv`, then to a
 *  bare `claude --resume` (the historical default — a bare fallback with no
 *  recorded command/argv at all has no CLI to detect, and every session this
 *  project mints an id for today is claude's). */

 *  resumable itself once a prompt is sent — and, like resume, never carries a
 *  prompt. Drops any stale `--resume`/`--session-id` first so we don't double or
 *  attempt a resume.
 *
 *  Deliberately ALWAYS space form (`--session-id <id>`), for every CLI
 *  including copilot — property 3 on `agentResumeCommand`'s doc comment
 *  above. This is NOT an oversight to "make consistent" with that function's
 *  `=`-form copilot `--resume`: the copilot CLI reference documents
 *  `--session-id ID` specifically in the space form, so the two flags are
 *  correctly asymmetric. `test/panerestore.test.ts` pins this explicitly so
 *  a future cleanup pass finds the reason, not just the inconsistency.
 *
 *  **opencode keeps no identity across this fallback, because it cannot**
 *  (#722): no opencode flag pre-assigns a session id — `--session` continues
 *  an existing one, and there is no `--session-id` — so the recorded id is
 *  dropped along with any stale session flag and the pane starts a genuinely
 *  new conversation, whose id the reconciler learns afterwards exactly as it
 *  does for any other bare opencode pane. Appending `--session-id` to an
 *  opencode line instead (what the shared arm would do) hands its TUI an
 *  unknown flag; appending `--session <id>` would be worse than that — it is
 *  precisely the doomed resume this function exists to avoid, since this arm
 *  is only reached when the caller has established that the session is not
 *  resumable.
 *
 *  **pi DOES keep its identity here** (#2126 P2), and that is not an
 *  inconsistency with the paragraph above — it is the same rule reaching the
 *  opposite answer on a different vendor fact. opencode loses its id because no
 *  opencode flag can pre-assign one; pi's `--session-id` is exactly such a flag,
 *  so the shared arm below is right for it and no pi branch is needed. The
 *  result is that this function and `agentResumeCommand` emit the IDENTICAL line
 *  for pi, which is the honest consequence of one flag meaning
 *  open-or-create — pinned in `test/panerestore.test.ts` so a later reader finds
 *  the reason rather than an apparent duplication. */

 *  see `PI_SOLO_MCP_RE`.
 *
 *  **codex joined with #2515 C2, and it is the seam rule again.** codex has no
 *  MCP config FLAG — its servers are `[mcp_servers.*]` tables in a TOML config
 *  — but it does have a flag that SELECTS which config file is layered on:
 *  `-p/--profile <name>`, which loads `CODEX_HOME/<name>.config.toml`. So the

 *    fills the empty grid (`dir`/`relativeTo` are then ignored). This anchor is
 *    what a flat `{dir, weight}[]` dropped, making nested layouts unreconstructible.
 *  - `dir` — the split direction to open in. Only the SECOND+ child of a split
 *    carries its split's direction; the split's first child is an anchor reused
 *    from an earlier step, never re-opened.
 *  - `weights` — the flex-grow chain from the inserted subtree's OUTERMOST slot
 *    down its left spine to this entry leaf (length 1 for a plain leaf child).
 *    `grid.openPane` resets flex to equal shares as it splits, so restore applies
 *    these afterward: the outermost entry is the weight of the (possibly new)
 *    split element this insertion creates, and each deeper entry is the weight one
 *    level in — exactly the values `grid.layoutSnapshot()` would read back. This
 *    is how the saved 25/75 divider drag survives instead of snapping to 50/50.
