// One reading out of the tab strip's published snapshot: is the ROSTER calling
// this pane's agent idle? (#2122 slice B, feeding slice A's
// `PaneActivity.noteRosterIdle`.)
//
// WHY THIS IS ITS OWN MODULE. The lookup is three nested absences deep — the
// group may not be in the payload, its summary may be a refusal, the agent may
// not be in the roster — and each of them has to answer `null` rather than
// `false`. Written inline at the call site in `main.ts` that is four
// hand-checked branches nobody can test; here it is a pure function over a
// literal.
//
// WHAT THE READING MEANS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. `idle_since_ms` is the idle
// REAPER's signal: "this agent holds no assignment / the reaper would consider
// killing it". It is emphatically NOT "parked at a prompt" (#2089), which is
// why `deriveAgentState` feeds it to the `idle` rung alone and never to
// `turn-done`. `docs/design/agents-tab.md` carries that distinction in full.
//
// NO IMPORT FROM `orchestration.ts`, deliberately. The shapes below are
// structural, so `StripViewPayload` satisfies them without this module reaching
// into a file whose transitive imports include the Tauri IPC seam — which is
// what keeps `node --test` able to load it, and what lets the tests build a
// three-field literal instead of a whole strip payload.
