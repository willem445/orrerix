//! The Codex **harness** (#2515 C1): the generated profile file, the launch
//! line, the store watcher and the solo MCP arm.
//!
//! Its sibling `codexsessions.rs` is about reading a store codex wrote; this
//! file is about the things loomux writes and the line it launches. The two
//! failure modes are independent — a lookup can be right while the profile
//! grants nothing, and vice versa.
//!
//! **What is worth pinning here, and why each is its own test.** Almost
//! everything in this slice fails SILENTLY. A profile whose top-level keys land
//! inside a table still parses; a contract that closes its own string
//! delimiter early still leaves a file on disk; a launch line missing `-p`
//! still starts codex. In every one of those cases the pane boots, looks
//! healthy, and simply has no trust, no tools or no contract — so the
//! assertions below are about the DOCUMENT and the LINE rather than about
//! whether the call returned `Ok`.
//!
//! An integration test, not inline `#[cfg(test)]`, per repo constraint 4.
//!
//! **No codex is ever run** (constraint 3), and not even `--help`: every vendor
//! fact these assertions encode is read blob-by-blob out of `openai/codex` at
//! tag `rust-v0.153.4` and quoted in `doc/design/codex.md`.
