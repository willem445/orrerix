// The repo's OWN `.orrerix/workflow.yml` (#222), checked against the pane's reader
// and validator — the two things a human sees when they open it in loomux.

// loomux dogfoods its own feature, which is only worth anything if the file it ships
// is a file the app is happy with. So this reads the real one off disk (not a
// fixture: a fixture would drift the moment someone edits the workflow) and asserts
// it opens with ZERO findings — errors *and* warnings, because a warning here means
// the graph loomux would draw of its own workflow has a block nothing points at.
//
// The backend half of this pin lives in `src-tauri/tests/workflow.rs`
// (`the_repos_own_workflow_file_parses_clean_against_the_real_parser`). Both halves
// exist because the two parsers are deliberately separate: the pane's is an editor
// giving live feedback on text a human is typing, the backend's is the engine. A file
// that only one of them accepts is a file the human is being lied to about — which is
// precisely the drift this test catches, forever.
