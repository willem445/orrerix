//     stored and nothing is written — it is a projection, exactly like
//     `isReady`.
//  2. **Clearing** is the human's explicit archive action, and it IS stored
//     (`cleared_ms` on the task, stamped by the board's own command). It hides
//     the row from the working view until they ask for it back. It never
//     deletes: the row, its notes and its links stay in `tasks.json`, and the
//     audit log records the action.
//
// What sinking must never do is override the human's manual priority order
// among rows that are still live — board order IS priority order, and "top =
// next" is a contract the orchestrator reads. So the split is a STABLE
// partition of each sibling list: within the live half, relative order is

// The board is a tree, so a filter cannot simply be `board.filter(pred)`: a

// model exists to show. Three rules, all here, all pinned:
//
//  1. **A match keeps its ancestor chain.** Matches render, and so does every
//     container above them, marked `context` so the view can render them as
//     scaffolding rather than as hits. Descendants of a match are NOT pulled in
//     — an epic matching `kind=epic` renders alone, and `shownKids` beside
//     `childCounts` is what tells the human what is inside it.
//  2. **An active filter overrides collapse, and never mutates it.** Standard
//     tree-view behaviour: a search that finds a row and then hides it inside a
//     collapsed container is worse than no search. The stored collapsed set is
//     untouched, so clearing the filter restores the exact shape the human
//     left. Note this is not merely a preference — under rule 1 a kept
//     container either has a kept descendant (so it MUST expand) or is a match
//     whose whole subtree was filtered out (so collapsing it changes nothing).
//     Collapse has no observable effect while a filter is active, and the view
//     renders the chevron inert to say so rather than offering a dead click.
//  3. **AND across families, OR within one.** An empty family constrains
//     nothing; it never means "match nothing".

 *  deliberately do not make: the next number after the highest, so a board can
 *  start a sprint at all. Without it the first sprint could only ever be set
 *  through the orchestrator, and a board whose sprints were all finished could

 *
 *  The row's OWN sprint is excluded: picking it is a write that changes

 *  `parentPickerChoices`, `kindPickerChoices`) omits the no-op choice too.
 *
 *  `clear` is whether the row carries a sprint at all — the backlog is the
 *  absence of one, so there is nothing to clear on a row already in it. The
 *  caller sends `0`, the backend's numeric CLEAR (§8 of the design note), and
 *  `0` is therefore filtered OUT of `options` even when a hand-edited board
 *  carries a row in it: offering it would be a menu entry reading "sprint 0"
 *  that silently performs the clear instead. The row keeps its `0` badge and
 *  its filter chip — nothing becomes unreachable — it just is not a sprint
 *  anything can be moved INTO.
 *
 *  Nothing here is a legality check. A sprint gates nothing and validates
 *  against nothing but its type, so unlike the parent picker there is no
