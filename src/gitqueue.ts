// A FIFO serializer for the mutating git commands (#726).
//
// DOM-free and pure so its state machine is unit-tested in Node
// (test/gitqueue.test.ts) rather than by racing real invokes — the repo's
// extract-pure-logic convention (layout.ts, steer.ts, refreshgate.ts, …).
//
// Why it exists. Every git-shelling `#[tauri::command]` used to be synchronous,
// so Tauri ran it on the webview main thread and the window froze for the whole
// `git` run. #726 moved them all onto a blocking pool — but that freeze was also
// an accidental mutual exclusion: while the main thread sat in one `git` spawn,
// a second invoke could not start. Two concurrent `git` invocations against the
// same worktree contend on `index.lock`, and git fails the loser. Nothing gets
// corrupted, but a user who clicks *stage* then *commit* in quick succession
// used to get both (the second invoke queued behind the first) and would now
// get an error toast instead. So the ordering is restored deliberately, here,
// where the freeze used to provide it for free.
//
// Why one global queue and not one per repo. The exclusion being restored WAS
// global — the main thread is one thread, so writes to unrelated repos were
// serialized too. Keying by the `repo` argument would confine the wait to one
// worktree, and for the `index.lock` hazard alone that would even be sound:
// each linked worktree has its own index. It is NOT sound for the rest —
// worktrees of one repo share `refs/` and `packed-refs`, where two
// `fetch --prune`s contend on `packed-refs.lock`, and two panes on two
// worktrees of one repo is loomux's standard shape rather than an edge case. A
// narrower key would trade a visible, bounded wait for an occasional error
// nobody can explain. The cost of the wider key is named below, not waved away.
//
// What this does NOT cover — two writers inside this very window:
//
//   1. The pane's own terminal. An agent running `git commit` in the worktree
//      the view is showing is a plain external process; loomux never excluded
//      it, before or after #726.
//   2. loomux's own backend. `Registry::spawn_agent_ex` calls
//      `git::git_worktree_add_sync` directly from its own thread
//      (orchestration/mod.rs), never through a command and so never through
//      this queue. It bypassed the freeze exactly the same way, so this is not
//      new — but it is inside the window, so "the window is serialized" would
//      be false, and this list exists to stop that from being claimed.
//
// So `index.lock` plus a surfaced error was always the real arbiter. This
// restores what the freeze provided and no more.
//
// The residual cost, stated because it is real: a slow head job delays every
// later mutating op, window-wide, including ones for unrelated repos. That is
// the same ordering the main thread imposed, and strictly better than the
// freeze it replaces (which killed the whole window for the same duration) —
// but the freeze was unmissable and a queue is silent, so the wait is bounded
// below, and the git view says so when it has to wait.

/** How long a job may sit unstarted before it is abandoned rather than run.
 *
 *  Bounding this is not optional. `run_git` spawns with no timeout, and
 *  `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` suppresses a *terminal* credential prompt, not a GUI
 *  credential helper — so `fetch`/`push`/`pull` against an unreachable remote
 *  can genuinely never return, and an unbounded queue behind one of those is a
 *  suppression with no answer for "the signal never clears" — INV-6 in
 *  `docs/design/performance.md` ("any suppression driven by a fallible signal
 *  has a release that does not depend on that signal"), the invariant behind
 *  #496, #513 and #518. The release here does not consult the head job at all:
 *  it is this job's own elapsed wait.
 *
 *  Why abandon rather than release: releasing the waiter would let its `git`
 *  spawn run *concurrently* with the stuck one, which is precisely the race
 *  this queue exists to prevent. The bound must fail the job, never smuggle it
 *  past the guard — so the caller gets an explicit error saying the op did not
 *  run, which beats a click that vanishes.
 *
 *  Why a minute: every non-network command in the mutating set is sub-second on
 *  any normal tree, and even a slow `fetch` is seconds, so a wait past a minute
 *  means the head is pathological rather than merely slow. A legitimately long
 *  push can still trip it; the queued op then fails loudly and is retried once
 *  the push lands, which beats both hanging forever and racing it. */
