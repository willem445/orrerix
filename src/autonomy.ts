// Pure decision/format helpers for the group panel's "Autonomous mode" section
// (#83, W2). No Tauri or DOM imports, so it's unit-testable under `node --test`
// (mirrors spawnexpiry.ts / orchbadge.ts). groupview.ts owns the DOM wiring and
// imports from here; orchestration.ts owns the typed command wrappers.
//
// The tricky bits this isolates and tests:
//   1. The auto-merge inversion. The backend flag is `auto_merge` (ON = the
//      orchestrator may merge itself). The human-facing control is the opposite
//      framing — a "Require human approval before merge" checkbox that is ON by
//      default (today's behaviour). Checkbox ON ⇔ auto_merge OFF. One place to
//      get the negation right.
//   2. The budget meter math (spend vs cap → fraction / percent / exhausted),
//      mirroring the backend `autonomy_budget_exhausted` rule.
//   3. The idle-tick status → human label mapping, including the null-countdown
//      discipline: a countdown is rendered ONLY for the statuses the backend
//      gives a real `eligible_in_secs` (counting_down / eligible / rate_capped);
//      the others (starting / paused / waiting_for_activity) never show a number,
//      even if one were passed — the whole point of the backend's rev-59 rework.
//
// Suspension is *not* reconstructed here: `orch_autonomy` reports it directly
// via `suspended` (true iff the budget enforcer flipped autonomy off, from a
// durable marker), so the panel just reads the flag.
