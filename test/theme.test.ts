// The colour seam — theme.ts and the three surfaces pinned to it (#879, slice A).
//
// loomux paints in three languages that cannot read each other. The stylesheet's `:root`
// custom properties style the chrome. The `<style>` block in index.html paints the app
// ground BEFORE the bundle exists, because otherwise startup flashes an unstyled white
// page. And xterm.js takes an ITheme object, because terminals render on a WebGL canvas
// where CSS custom properties do not reach. Three copies of the same decision, in CSS, in
// HTML, and in TypeScript, with nothing but care keeping them equal.
//
// src/theme.ts is now the one copy, and these tests are what make that true rather than
// aspirational: each surface is read from disk and compared against the module. A palette
// edit that lands in two of the three places goes red here instead of shipping as a
// one-frame flash of the previous release's background, or as a terminal whose colours
// belong to a design nobody kept.
//
// The ANSI test earns its place separately: sixteen slots of near-identical hex strings is
// exactly the shape a copy-paste typo hides in. Collapse two slots and every CLI that uses
// the losing one goes invisible — no error, no exception, and no other test in this repo
// would notice. Run `npm test`.
