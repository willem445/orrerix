/// # Why this is the third version
///
/// v1 was eleven literal needles; rev-440 broke it by naming `.join(g.as_str())`,
/// the exact line this change deleted from `sessions.rs`. v2 parsed arguments
/// structurally but decided "is this a group?" from the **binding's name**
/// (`group`/`gid`/`g.id`), so rev-450 broke it with the same line — `g` is not
/// on that list. Any guard that asks what a variable is *called* can be stepped
/// over by renaming it, and a security tripwire with that property is theatre.
///
/// # So this one does not ask about names at all
///
/// It is **default-deny on two name-independent axes**, and a group path has to
/// cross at least one of them:
///
/// 1. **The receiver.** A group path is `<orchestration root>/<group>`, so every
///    expression that builds a path *from the root* is denied unless it is on
///    [`ROOT_USES`]. That catches `default_root().join(g.as_str())` — rev-450's
///    case — because the offending part is the receiver, whatever the argument
///    is called. It also catches clone-then-`push`, since the `.clone()` is
///    itself a root use.
/// 2. **The `.as_str()` shape.** Turning a typed id into a path component is
///    spelled `x.as_str()`, and `Vec<String>::push(x.as_str())` does not
///    compile — so a `.join(…as_str())` or `.push(…as_str())` is a path build
///    almost by construction, regardless of receiver or name. Exactly one is
///    permitted: `group_dir_at`'s own.
///
/// A third, weaker pass keeps the old name heuristic as a *supplement* for a
/// group joined onto some already-derived directory. It is allowed to be
/// incomplete; the two axes above are near-total — the one shape that crosses
/// neither is a [`ROOT_USES`]-sanctioned root alias feeding a path component
/// built without `.as_str()`, which is exactly what this weaker pass is here to
/// catch.
///
/// # Scope: both production source roots, and why the second one is required
///
/// Every `.rs` under `src-tauri/src` **and** under `crates/loomux-engine/src`.
/// Tests are not scanned — they build expected paths from group ids constantly,
/// which is their job.
///
/// The compiler covers what no scan can: `GroupId` has no `AsRef<Path>`, so it
/// cannot reach a `join` as a *value*. That absence is asserted here, since
/// nothing else enforces it.
///
/// That assertion is what forces the second root, and it is a security
/// property, not tidiness. `GroupId` is defined in `loomux-engine` (#888 slice
/// A2), and Rust's orphan rule means a foreign impl of a foreign trait —
/// `AsRef<Path>` for `GroupId` — can be written in **exactly one crate**: the
/// one that owns the type. So the only directory where the violation can now be
/// spelled at all is `crates/loomux-engine/src`. A scan confined to
/// `src-tauri/src` would still pass every run, forever, while watching a
/// directory the defect can no longer reach — an inert tripwire that reads as
/// enforcement, which is worse than no test, because CLAUDE.md constraint 6
/// cites this assertion as the enforcement of the whole `group_id` path-trust
/// boundary.
///
/// The generalization for the batches still to come: when a type moves, the
/// question is not "where did the violation used to live" but **"where can it
/// be spelled now"** — and for a trait impl the orphan rule answers that
/// exactly. `ROOTS` below asserts per root that it found files, and a further
/// assertion pins that the file *defining* `GroupId` was actually in scope, so
/// a stale root fails loudly instead of scanning nothing.
///
/// The same move is why the impl is now matched on its **shape** rather than on
/// the single spelling `impl AsRef<Path> for GroupId`: the defining file
/// imports neither `Path` nor `AsRef` by a qualified path, so the qualified
/// forms are the likely ones there, and a scan that only knew the bare form
/// would report green on them.
///
/// # What this scan catches, and what it does not
///
/// Stated plainly, because a guard that implies completeness it does not have
/// is how the *previous* two versions of this test came to be trusted while
/// broken. This is a **textual** scan; the honest claim is "it catches the
/// spellings anyone would actually write", not "it cannot be evaded".
///
/// Caught:
///
/// - both production source roots (`ROOTS`), i.e. every directory where the
///   impl can legally be written at all;
/// - the `AsRef<…Path>` impl with either position qualified or bare —
///   `impl AsRef<Path>`, `impl AsRef<std::path::Path>`,
///   `impl std::convert::AsRef<Path>`, and the mixed forms;
/// - the two name-independent join axes (the root receiver, and the
///   `.as_str()` path-component shape), whatever the binding is called.
///
/// **Not** caught, and no attempt is made to:
///
/// - an **aliased import** — `use std::path::Path as P;` then
///   `impl AsRef<P> for GroupId`. The text simply is not there to match.
/// - a **macro-generated** impl, for the same reason.
/// - an impl **header split across lines**: this scan reads one line at a time.
/// - **`PathBuf::push`**, which cannot be told from `Vec::push` textually. It
///   appears nowhere in either crate today; it would not be caught if it were
///   the first one added.
/// - a `GroupId` reached through a **re-export alias** in the impl header.
///
/// That tail is unbounded, and chasing it with more pattern-matching buys less
/// than it costs — a scan is not a type system. What actually holds the
/// property is the **compiler**: with no `AsRef<Path>` in the tree, a `GroupId`
/// cannot reach a `join` as a value at all. This scan is defence in depth over
