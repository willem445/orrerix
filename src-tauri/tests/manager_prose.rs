//! Substance pins for the **manager's prose** — `templates/manager.md`, the
//! `mechanics_core(Role::Manager)` arm it must stay in lockstep with, and the
//! `{{MANAGER_NOTE}}` fragment that is the orchestrator's whole half of the
//! feature (#1161 M4).
//!
//! Its own file, and not `tests/prompts.rs`, for a reason that is a property of
//! the feature rather than a filing preference: `prompts.rs` pins what a
//! **default** group reads (its `rails()` turns the advanced orchestrator off,
//! and its module doc calls that "the whole scope of this file"), and a manager
//! exists only where a workflow file declares one —
//! `write_instruction_files`'s class-fallback loop deliberately never writes
//! `manager.md` for a default group. Every test here therefore needs a
//! workflow-declared roster, which is `tests/workflow.rs`'s shape; it is split
//! out from there for the same reason `manager_lifecycle.rs` was (#1161 M3),
//! to keep three concurrent slices off one 9000-line file.
//!
//! Integration tests, not unit tests, per CLAUDE.md constraint 4: a test
//! executable linking the full lib needs the comctl32-v6 manifest `build.rs`
//! embeds through `-tests`-scoped link args.
//!
//! The three properties that make a prose pin able to fail at all are
//! `prompts.rs`'s, and [`flat`], [`section`] and [`pinned`] below are the same
//! three helpers for the same three reasons: whitespace-collapsed matching (a
//! re-wrapped paragraph must not read as a deleted rule), region scoping (a
//! rule stated in two places is satisfied by either, so the pin must name the
//! region that OWES it), and uniqueness (an anchor occurring twice inside its
//! region cannot fail when the rule it names is deleted).
//!
//! Every anchor below was mutation-verified: delete the markdown unit that
//! carries the rule and the owning test goes red, naming the rule it lost.
