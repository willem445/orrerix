//! The review driver's **outside world**: the `gh` seam, the observations it
//! turns into [`crate::reviewdrive`] facts, the audit vocabulary and the
//! kick-back notices (#1778 S3).
//!
//! Design note: `doc/design/review-driver.md`. This module is to
//! [`crate::reviewdrive`] what [`crate::mqdriver`] is to [`crate::mqloop`]: the
//! half that runs child processes and renders text, with every decision still
//! made next door by [`crate::reviewdrive::decide`]. It is Tauri-free, so the
//! registry wiring in `src-tauri` — the state lock, the spawns, the deliveries,
//! the board note — is the only part that is not testable from this crate.
//!
//! # Why a runner of its own, when `MqRunner` already exists
//!
//! §3.1 item 1 is the reason, and it is structural rather than stylistic: **the
//! driver may never build a merge or any other landing verb**, and
//! [`crate::mqdriver::MqRunner`] hands its holder a `git` method — the one
//! through which every landing verb in this codebase is spelled. [`RdRunner`]
//! has `gh` and nothing else, so a driver holding `&dyn RdRunner` cannot reach
//! `git push` at all, whatever a later author writes. That is a compiler-checked
//! narrowing rather than a source scan's opinion, and it is the half of item 1
//! the scan cannot give.
//!
//! It costs no second implementation: the one real runner is
//! [`crate::mqdriver::ProcessRunner`], and the impl below is a second *view* of
//! it rather than a second runner — same `current_dir` hardening, same
//! `NO_COLOR`/`GH_PAGER` environment, and the same bounded
//! `subproc::capture_raw_with_timeout` child §2.4 requires. One process runner,
//! two views of it, and the narrow view is the one the driver gets.
//!
//! **What this does not close**, stated because a narrowing that oversells
//! itself is worse than none: `gh` can also write. `gh pr merge`, `gh pr edit`
//! and `gh pr ready` all ride the method that is still here, so the `gh` half of
//! §3.1's items 1 and 3 is the source scan's job — this trait only takes `git`
//! off the table.
