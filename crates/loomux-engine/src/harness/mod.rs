//! Harness adapters — a pane that **reports** what it did, instead of a pane
//! loomux has to **read** (#84, slice R1).
//!
//! `doc/design/harness-adapters.md` is this module's contract (PR #2193). Every
//! name below is fixed by its §1, and R2 may not change one without amending
//! that note in the same PR. What follows is the reason each shape is what it
//! is; the note carries the argument in full.
//!
//! # What a harness adapter replaces
//!
//! Today loomux drives every agent CLI through a ConPTY: it types an
//! echo-verified bracketed paste, waits for the screen to go quiet, and learns
//! what happened by **scraping the pane's own output ring** — readiness markers,
//! question grids, a statusline. That machinery is the source of a long tail of
//! delivery bugs (#1663, #903, #871, #1591, #112, #179), and none of it can tell
//! a remote client what a pane is waiting for, because the answer only exists as
//! pixels.
//!
//! A structured harness replaces the reading half. Claude Code's
//! `--output-format stream-json` emits one JSON object per line describing
//! exactly what the session did — turn boundaries, assistant text, tool calls
//! and their results, token usage, the session id. This module turns those lines
//! into [`HarnessEvent`]s, which every other part of loomux consumes instead of
//! a screen.
//!
//! # The boundary
//!
//! This is an **engine leaf**: `serde`/`serde_json` and `std`, nothing else. No
//! `tauri`, no pty, no pane, no `AppHandle` — and, in R1, no caller. It is
//! deliberately not wired into any spawn path (that is R2), so it can land
//! parallel with the #888 A4 chain without touching
//! `src-tauri/src/orchestration/mod.rs` at all.
//!
//! # What R1 ships, and what it deliberately does not
//!
//! Ships: the vocabulary below, the stream-json decoder and the child driver
//! ([`claude`]), the VT renderer ([`transcript`]), and the per-pane event log
//! ([`EventLog`]).
//!
//! Does not ship, and says so rather than stubbing it silently:
//! [`AgentPane::answer`] on a Claude pane **refuses**. Answering a permission
//! request needs `permissions.json` and the `permission_prompt` MCP tool, which
//! are R2's; a refusal that names R2 is honest, where an `Ok(())` that dropped
//! the decision would be a permission system that silently approves nothing and
//! reports success.
//!
//! # Two rules about *not knowing*, which are the whole reason this enum is
//! shaped the way it is
//!
//! A PTY pane implements the same [`AgentPane`] trait and emits the same
//! [`HarnessEvent`], because a second vocabulary would mean a second consumer
//! for every feature that reads panes. It knows far less, and the note's §1.3
//! fixes exactly how that is spelled:
//!
//! 1. **A fact the pane does not have is `None`, never a sentinel.** An
//!    `"unknown"` string or a `-1` is a value every `match` arm can forget to
//!    check, and it reads as data.
//! 2. **A fact the pane only INFERRED is [`HarnessEvent::Observed`], never the
//!    reported variant.** Scraped evidence and reported fact must not share a
//!    constructor: a consumer written for [`HarnessEvent::PermissionRequest`]
//!    would otherwise silently accept a grid heuristic, and the entire point of
//!    the structured path is that it does not have to. This is the one place the
//!    enum is deliberately asymmetric, and
//!    [`ObservedEvent`] exists only so that asymmetry has a name.
