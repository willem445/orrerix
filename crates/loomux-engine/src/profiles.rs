//! Repo-defined agent personas, read from the **standard** GitHub Copilot
//! *agents.md* convention: `<repo>/.github/agents/<name>.md` (also
//! `<name>.agent.md`). These are the same custom-agent files Copilot CLI reads
//! natively, so a repo's personas live with the workspace instead of in a
//! loomux-specific config — and are shareable between developers via the repo
//! (issue #51).
//!
//! **Harvested from PR #105** (`agent-prototype`, superseded by #222): the
//! parser, the discovery walk, the append/replace modes and the
//! non-overridable mechanics core are all its design, brought over rather than
//! rebased. What changed in the move to the block model (#222):
//!
//! - A profile no longer *maps itself onto a role*. `.loomux/workflow.yml` says
//!   which block uses which persona (`profile: .github/agents/x.md`), so
//!   `profile_for_role`'s auto-mapping-by-filename is gone: a persona file can
//!   no longer take effect just by existing. It is opt-in, by reference. The
//!   `role:`/`kind:` frontmatter survives only as a **compatibility check** —
//!   if a file says `kind: planner` and a `worker` block points at it, that is
//!   an error rather than a silent capability change.
//! - Claude's persona delivery has changed mechanism twice since #105:
//!   `claude --agents '<json>' --agent <id>` (#222, post-dating #105)
//!   carried it inline for a time, until round #417 correction 6 moved it
//!   BACK to a file — `--agent <handle>` alone, naming a loomux-generated
//!   `~/.claude/agents/<handle>.md` — after a live demo showed the inline
//!   payload (widened by #416 to carry the full role contract, not just a
//!   short persona) could exceed Windows `CreateProcessW`'s 32,767-character
//!   command-line limit. `--append-system-prompt-file` itself is back too,
//!   as the write-failure fallback (see `PersonaInject::claude_append_
//!   system_prompt_file`'s doc in `mod.rs`) — the #222 move away from it was
//!   about `--agents` being newer and native, never about the file-based
//!   flag having a functional problem, so nothing disqualified it from
//!   returning as a fallback. See `persona_inject` in `registry/agentfiles.rs`.
//!

//! name: worker
//! description: Repo-specific worker persona.
//! tools: [read, edit, shell]      # copilot-native; loomux READS it (see below)
//! model: opus                     # copilot-native; loomux ignores it (see below)

//! <persona instructions>
//! ```
//!
//! **`tools:` is copilot's, but loomux cannot ignore it (#802).** It is a
//! FILTER, not an addition. Per GitHub's [custom-agents configuration
//! reference](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/custom-agents-configuration),
//! *Tools processing*: *"The `tools` list filters the set of tools that are made
//! available to the agent - whether built-in or sourced from MCP servers"*, and
//! *"If no tools are specified, all available tools are enabled"*. So a persona
//! file carrying `tools: [read, edit]` and pointed at by a `cli: copilot` block
//! silently strips **loomux's own MCP tools** from the delegate it launches: the
//! server still loads (it rides `--additional-mcp-config`, so the CLI lists it)
//! and every one of its tools is filtered out — an agent that cannot `report`,
//! cannot read the task board, and cannot be steered. That is the live failure
//! #802 reports, and it is invisible from argv, which is why the list is parsed
//! here now instead of being skipped as "copilot's business".
//!
//! What loomux does about it lives in `persona_inject`/`write_copilot_agent_file`
//! (`registry/agentfiles.rs`): it never edits the user's file (#222), it re-points `--agent` at a
//! loomux-owned copy carrying the SAME list plus the loomux grant. The grant
//! spelling is the documented one: *"You can also explicitly enable all tools
//! from a specific MCP server using `some-mcp-server/*`"*.
//!
//! **`model:` is not a loomux knob.** Copilot reads it itself when it loads the
//! file via `--agent`; loomux takes the model from the *block* (`model:` in
//! `workflow.yml`), which is the one place that works on every CLI and is the
//! value the launcher, the audit log and the guardrails all agree on. It is
//! parsed here only so a reader (and the workflow pane) can see what the file
//! says. Two sources of truth for one pinned model is exactly the kind of
//! silent-divergence bug this whole issue is about.
//!
//! ## Append vs replace (`mode:`)
//!
//! - `mode: append` (**default**) — the persona is an *addendum*: loomux's
//!   built-in role contract (the `report`/git-workflow guarantees, MCP tool
//!   guidance, session discipline) still applies and the repo text layers on
//!   top.
//! - `mode: replace` — the persona replaces the built-in role *body*. loomux
//!   still injects the **non-overridable mechanics core**
//!   (`orchestration::mechanics_core`, which stays in `src-tauri` next to the
//!   role templates it renders), so a replace persona that
//!   forgets to mention `report()` or the branch→PR discipline stays
//!   functional. That is the invariant `replace_mode_persona_keeps_mechanics_core`
//!   pins: replace can change *who the agent is*, never *what loomux guarantees*.
//!
//! A persona can never change what an agent is *allowed* to do — the capability
//! class comes from the block's `kind`, which is a closed enum (see
//! [`workflow`](crate::workflow)). `allow:` can only add pre-approved tool
//! patterns *within* what the class permits: deny rules beat allow rules on
//! both CLIs, so a reviewer persona cannot allow itself back into `git push`.
