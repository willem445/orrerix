// `sessionlog.json` (#2116) — orrerix's own sidecar record of the harness
// sessions the human has touched: what the pane was called, which CLI ran it,
// where it ran, and the notes the human wrote about it.
//
// Pure encode/decode + validation, DOM-free and unit-tested, modelled on
// `boardprefs.ts` (#1270) line for line. `uistate.rs` stores the blob
// atomically as `sessionlog.json` and never parses it beyond "is it JSON at
// all"; this module owns the schema.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// What it is, and what it is not
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Each agent CLI already keeps its own session log — Claude Code's transcripts,
// Copilot's, OpenCode's store — and the sessions browser lists sessions by
// scanning them (`docs/design/session-index.md`). Those files are the harness's
// and orrerix NEVER writes them. This is the other half: the things orrerix
// knows and the harness does not — the name the human gave the pane, and what
// they wrote about the session.
//
// So losing this file loses notes and recorded pane names, and nothing else.
// The sessions list still enumerates every session from the harness stores; the
// rows just fall back to their transcript titles, which is the pre-#2116 list.
//
// It is a sibling of `settings.json` rather than a key inside it for the reason
// #887 gave for `sshprofiles.json` and #1270 for `boardprefs.json`: a
// multi-entry keyed structure with its own lifecycle does not belong in a flat
// bag of app-wide scalars. It is NOT in a group directory either — a basic
// (non-orchestration) pane has no group, and a note would then have two homes.
//
// The session id is a MAP KEY here and never a path — no `.join`, so hard
// constraint 6's surface is untouched by this file and by the two commands
// behind it.
