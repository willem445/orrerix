//! The declared-root registry's **admit** side — who may mint a declared root
//! (#1042 slice B; layer 2 of #888 §0, the other half of `tests/groupid.rs`).
//!
//! Integration tests, not unit tests: they link the full lib, which on Windows
//! needs the comctl32-v6 manifest `build.rs` embeds via `-tests`-scoped link
//! args (CLAUDE.md constraint 4). The registry MECHANISM has its own unit tests
//! next to it in `crates/loomux-engine/src/rootreg.rs`, where no lib link is
//! needed; nothing here re-tests containment, the descendant rule or
//! canonicalization. What is tested here is the half slice A could not reach:
//! **what actually puts a root in the registry.**
//!
//! Three parts, and the third is the one that matters most:
//!
//! 1. **The host wrapper** — the error mapping every admit site shares, so a
//!    refusal reaches a caller in the `code: message` shape the file commands
//!    already answer in.
//! 2. **Engine-derived declaration** — a group's checkout is declared as the
//!    group is created AND as it is resumed, and an agent's worktree as it is
//!    cut. With a negative control: a directory nobody declared does not
//!    resolve, without which every assertion above would also pass against a
//!    registry that simply said yes.
//! 3. **The source scans** — `DeclaredRoot` has no `AsRef<Path>` (the carry
//!    from #1055's review), and *every* admit site in the workspace is on an
//!    argued allowlist. `src-tauri/src/rootreg.rs`'s module doc makes a claim
//!    in one sentence — "these are all the ways a root gets declared" — and
//!    part 3 is the thing that keeps that sentence true after the next feature
//!    lands. Default-deny with one row per permitted site, each carrying its
//!    reason, and a stale row fails as loudly as a new site does.
//!
//! What is **not** testable in this slice, stated rather than glossed: that a
//! wire caller cannot admit. The enforcement for that is the listener's
//! default-deny dispatcher (C2), which does not exist yet — `admit_root`'s
//! `disabled` classification is written down (its own doc comment, and
//! `docs/design/groupid-and-path-roots.md`) and C2's roster test is what will
//! pin it. Claiming a test for it here would be claiming coverage this slice
//! does not have.

/// which is why the allowlist counts are exact rather than a maximum: a rename
/// drops every count to zero and fails here instead of passing green. Nor is the
