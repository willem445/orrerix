// Pure connect-gesture reducer + per-channel color/number assignment for #271's

// at a time, globally, across every tab, and orchestration.ts keeps that single
// module-level `pending` variable — calling `reduceConnect` on every fired
// `PaneMenuAction` to get the next pending state plus whatever backend call (if any)
// needs to happen. Keeping the reducer pure (explicit state in, next state + effect
// out) is what makes the arm/complete/cancel/self-click machine unit-testable without
// simulating a DOM (CLAUDE.md's testing convention).
