// The `markFirstInput()` enumeration, executable (#570; #518/#528 residual).
//
// THE INVARIANT. The human-origin bit that reaches the backend (`write_pty`'s
// `human`) is only ever as good as the list of frontend paths that mark it.
// #440 B2-R and #518 both established that list the same way — by hand, by
// grepping — and the list is not written down anywhere a compiler or a test
// can check. A future input path that reaches the PTY without calling
// `markFirstInput()`/`markHumanInput()` degrades the bit silently, and the
// degradation is not the harmless direction: `onData` reads the latch
// synchronously, so an unmarked human keystroke leaves as `human: false`, and
// the backend's keystroke-recency clock — the thing that stops loomux pasting
// over what somebody is typing — never learns a human was there. That is the
// clobber every guard in `humanorigin.ts` exists to prevent.
//
// WHY A SOURCE SCAN AND NOT A RUNTIME TEST. The marks live in `pane.ts`'s DOM
// wiring, which this repo deliberately validates by hand rather than against a
// simulated DOM (see CLAUDE.md). So the property "no input path skips the
// mark" cannot be asserted by calling anything; it is a property of the call
// GRAPH, and the cheapest honest way to pin a call graph this small is to read
// the source. `hiddenrule.test.ts` is the precedent — a stylesheet invariant
// its own subject's unit tests could never see, pinned by parsing the file.
//
// WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is a tripwire, not a proof. It knows the shapes the
// input paths have TODAY; a genuinely novel vector (a new xterm API, a direct
// `invoke("write_pty")`) is not in its table and would not fire. That is why
// the last test asserts every rule still matches real code: a rule that has
// silently stopped matching anything is worse than no rule, because it reports
// green about a file it is no longer reading.
