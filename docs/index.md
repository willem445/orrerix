# Orrerix documentation
{: .no_toc }

Define the vision. Walk away. Come back to shipped software.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

Orrerix runs fleets of AI coding agents unsupervised, on real software discipline:
review gates and green CI before anything merges, work tracked on GitHub and a
live task board, your own CLIs and custom workflows — agents follow the process,
not the other way around.

The name comes from the **orrery**: a desk-sized geared model of the solar
system where every planet and moon runs its own track at its own period, and the
whole model stays in phase because one mechanism drives all of it — like the
Whipple Museum's [Grand Orrery](https://www.whipplemuseum.cam.ac.uk/explore-whipple-collections/astronomy/grand-orrery), George Adams, London, c. 1750. Here it is
a matrix of terminal panes, each carrying an agent (or just a shell), with one
orchestrator holding them in phase.

Orrerix gives you Windows Terminal–class smoothness with the multiplexing
features it lacks: instant matrix splits, nameable panes, a native session
browser that restores Claude Code, GitHub Copilot CLI, and OpenCode sessions
straight into a pane, and — the headline feature — a built-in
**orchestrator/worker** workflow for running a small fleet of AI agents, each
in its own visible pane, that you gatekeep only at review and merge.

## What's here

- **[Getting started](getting-started.html)** — install, first launch, first agent pane.
- **[Core concepts](core-concepts.html)** — panes, the split grid, and the full
  keyboard-shortcut table.
- **[Orchestration guide](orchestration.html)** — agent groups, the task board, and
  the `agent-ready` / `agent-investigation` label handshake.
- **[Autonomous & supervised modes](autonomous-mode.html)** — the idle-tick
  autonomous mode, the token budget, auto-merge / auto-release, and supervised
  dangerous mode.
- **Feature pages** — [git view](features/git-view.html),
  [GitHub issues view](features/github-issues.html),
  [voice prompts](features/voice-prompts.html),
  [steering & attachments](features/steering.html), the
  [session browser & editor launch](features/session-browser.html), the
  [side dock](features/side-dock.html), and the
  [to-do pane](features/todo-pane.html).
- **[Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.html)** — the classics: whisper DLLs, `gh`
  auth, mic permission, disk.

## For contributors

This site is the **user** guide. If you want to build on orrerix, the developer
docs stay in the repository:

- [`README.md`](https://github.com/willem445/orrerix/blob/main/README.md) — the
  pitch, the stack, and the build/run commands.
- [`docs/design/architecture.md`](https://github.com/willem445/orrerix/blob/main/docs/design/architecture.md)
  — the source tree, module by module, and the extension seams.
- [`CLAUDE.md`](https://github.com/willem445/orrerix/blob/main/CLAUDE.md) — the
  hard constraints and code conventions for working in this codebase.
- [`docs/design/`](https://github.com/willem445/orrerix/tree/main/docs/design) —
  per-feature design notes (why things are built the way they are).

> This documentation describes only what ships on `main` today. Where a feature
> is still in flight, the page says so rather than describing something that
> isn't there yet.
