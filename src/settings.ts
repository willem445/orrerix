// Durable app-wide settings (#370) — the first of these, and deliberately
// config-file-only: there is no Settings/Preferences UI anywhere in loomux
// today (checked before adding this), and CLAUDE.md's "don't design for
// hypothetical future requirements" argues against building one just to host
// a single boolean. Persisted via the SAME mechanism tabstore.ts/uistate.rs
// already use for the tab set (atomic write, corrupt-quarantine on load) —
// a sibling `settings.json`, not a new storage layer. Pure encode/decode here
// (DOM-free, unit-tested, mirrors tabstore.ts); main.ts loads it once at boot
// via pty.ts's loadSettings/saveSettings wrappers and calls setSettings(),
// after which every reader (pane.ts's keydown handler, synchronously, on
// every keystroke) just calls getSettings().
//
// No hot-reload: editing settings.json by hand takes effect on the next
// launch, not immediately — there is no file watch on it (unlike tabs.json,
// which the app itself writes continuously; this file is user-edited, and a
// watch would mean reconciling a concurrent external edit against in-memory
// state for a single boolean, which is not worth the complexity yet).
