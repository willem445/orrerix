// Pure presentation mapping for the manager pane's unread-mail chip (#1161 M5):
// the backend's `orch-mailbox-changed` push (and the `orch_mailbox_status`
// seed) → the label/tooltip on the pane header and the marker on a minimized
// pane's dock chip. DOM-free, like `queuebadge.ts` and `heldbadge.ts`, so the
// wording and the count rules are unit-testable without a webview.
//
// **What the chip is for.** The manager pane is the one pane no fleet traffic is
// delivered into: `deliver_prompt` refuses a `Role::Manager` target for every
// delivery outside `permitted_into_manager_pane`'s three-element set — the two
// kickoffs, plus the post-compact re-grounding notice decision D2 carved out
// (`docs/design/manager.md`'s table). `MidSession`, which is what every other
// producer sends, is refused. News from the orchestrator reaches it by PULL:
// `message_manager`
// writes a durable row, the manager runs `check_mail()` at the start of its next
// turn, and its next turn is the next time its human speaks to it. So without a
// chip the human's only signal that anything happened is the manager telling
// them after they have already started talking — which is one conversation too
// late to decide whether to have it.
//
// **Why the chip does NOT render the unread cap**, unlike `.pane-queue`'s
// `3/8` (`QUEUE_MAX_PER_PANE` is 8, not 32 — the two caps are easy to cross).
// There, the cap is the fact that makes the number legible, because a full queue
// DROPS arrivals. Here nothing is ever dropped: at
// `mailbox::UNREAD_MAX` the WRITER is refused, loudly, with the alternatives
// spelled out in the refusal text (say it in your own pane, `ask_human`,
// `request_attention`) — so the consequence of a full mailbox reaches the human
// on a surface of its own rather than needing to be inferred from a badge. That
// keeps this module's only input the one number the shipped event already
// carries, instead of widening two shipped contracts (the event payload and
// `orch_mailbox_status`'s return) to render a cue for a state that means "you
// have been away for a very long time".
