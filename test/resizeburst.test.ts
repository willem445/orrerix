// #1149: the Sessions strip's open/close lagged because the fit debounce could
// not coalesce. These tests measure that in the only unit that means anything —
// HOW MANY FITS a given stream of geometry changes produces — rather than
// asserting the delay arithmetic back at itself.
//
// The simulator below is the load-bearing part, so it is worth saying what it
// models and what it does not. It replays a list of `ResizeObserver` delivery
// times through a single re-armable timer, firing a due timer BEFORE the tick
// it is due at or before. That ordering is the browser's: a `setTimeout`
// resolves from the task queue, while a `ResizeObserver` callback is delivered
// later in the same frame's rendering steps (HTML standard, "update the
// rendering"). It is exactly why a 16 ms debounce never coalesced two 60 Hz
// frames, and getting it wrong in the other direction would make the old policy
// look better than it was.
//
// What it does NOT model: the cost of a fit, xterm's write queue (`doFit`
// defers the geometry change behind `term.write("", cb)`, #432 item 2), and the
// `shouldResizePty` skips that can drop a scheduled fit's PTY call afterwards
// (panefit.ts). Those only ever REMOVE resizes, so every count here is an upper
// bound on what reaches ConPTY, for both policies alike.
