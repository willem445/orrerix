// Orrerix itself is a native (Tauri) desktop app, not a JS program — so this
// package ships no binary. Instead it fetches the matching GitHub release
// asset for the host platform, installs/caches it, and launches it. The
// per-platform logic mirrors install.sh / install.ps1 so all three install
// paths behave the same.
//
// The command has three subcommands (#845):
//
//   orrerix           launch the installed app; install it only if missing
//   orrerix update    install/refresh the app from the newest release on the
//                     installed build's channel — the only path that fetches
//                     when something is already installed or cached
//   orrerix version   print this launcher's version
//   orrerix help      print usage
//
// Plain `orrerix` deliberately never upgrades: the silent installers terminate
// a running app to replace its files, so autoupdate killed live agents (#815)
// and the update decision belongs to the human as `orrerix update`.
//
// `orrerix update` is channel-aware and never downgrades (#815/#816/#846) —
// see the "update resolution" section for why both halves are load-bearing.
//
// Dependency-free on purpose: `npx orrerix` should have nothing to compile
// and nothing to trust beyond Node's own stdlib (Node >=18 for global fetch).

// Two axes, and conflating them is the trap this block exists to stop. They
// moved at different times, which is what makes them separate axes rather than
// one rename told twice.
//
//   PRODUCT_NAMES  Tauri's `productName`. It names everything the BUNDLER
//                  creates, which is everything this launcher has to
//                  recognise on a user's machine: the macOS bundle
//                  (`Orrerix.app`), the Windows install directory, its
//                  Add/Remove key (tauri-bundler's nsis/installer.nsi defines
//                  UNINSTKEY off ${PRODUCTNAME}), and every release asset
//                  filename. #1153 flipped it.
//
//   MAIN_BINARY    Tauri's `mainBinaryName`, which this app does not set. The
//                  config schema is explicit that it then "uses the output
//                  binary from cargo", so the executable INSIDE the bundle is
//                  whatever `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`'s `[package] name` says —
//                  `orrerix.exe` / `Contents/MacOS/orrerix` since #1562, and
//                  `loomux.exe` / `Contents/MacOS/loomux` before it. Reading
//                  this axis as though it followed the product name is how a
//                  probe ends up matching nothing at all (#1294); reading it as
//                  though it never changes is how a probe stops finding the
//                  install it is supposed to protect.
//
// The rule from docs/design/rebrand-protocol.md applies here verbatim: emit
// exactly one spelling, accept every spelling on every reading surface, and
// write the accepted set down exactly once. These arrays are that one place —
// index 0 is the emit spelling, and every reader iterates the whole array
// newest-first, so a machine carrying both installs resolves the current one.
//
// Dropping the old spelling would be a silent regression, never a compile
// error: an `orrerix update` that cannot see a pre-rename install reports
// "nothing installed", which is the exact input `updateBaseline` treats as
// safe to order against this launcher's own version — #816's downgrade guard
// disarmed by a rename.

// silently, and this is the only place that would have to notice.

// PRODUCT_NAMES, and for a sharper reason: an NSIS in-place upgrade deletes the

// hand while the old app was running — still carries it, and an install this
// launcher cannot see is an install it cannot protect. `updateBaseline` treats

const HELP = `${CLI} ${PKG_VERSION} — ${PRODUCT} desktop launcher

Launches the ${PRODUCT} desktop app (installing it first if needed). Run

USAGE
  ${CLI}            Launch the installed app, or install it if missing. Never
                    updates an existing install.
  ${CLI} update     Install/refresh the app from the newest GitHub release on
                    your channel: a stable install stays on stable, a beta
                    install takes the newest build of either kind. Never
                    downgrades. On Windows and macOS the launcher refuses while
                    the app is running — the installer would close it.
  ${CLI} version    Print this launcher's version.
  ${CLI} help       Show this help.
  ${CLI} --help, -h Same as \`${CLI} help\`.
  ${CLI} --version  Same as \`${CLI} version\`.

// ---------- Linux AppImage cache ----------

// The newest cached AppImage for this platform wins, on every platform's rule.
// On Linux the cached AppImage IS the install, so plain `orrerix` launches the
// newest cached build and never downloads — `orrerix update` is the only path
// that fetches again (#845). Download recency is a fine stand-in for version
// recency: cache files are only ever created by a download, never touched
// after. Deliberately no "prefer the launcher's own version" bias — update can
// install a build NEWER than the launcher, and plain launch must surface it.
//
// `dirs` is a list because the rename gave the cache a second directory to read
// (cacheDirs). Recency is compared ACROSS them rather than per-directory: the
// question is "what is the newest build on this machine", and answering it
// per-directory would let a stale pre-rename build beat a newer one purely for
// sitting under the older name.
//
// The filename is matched against every accepted product name, since a cached
// AppImage's name is whatever the release it came from was called. On Linux
// that name is also the ONLY version record there is (appImageVersion), so a
// spelling this misses is a build `update` cannot order against.
//
// stat once per file into a pair, then sort: statting inside the comparator ran
// it O(n log n) times, and threw uncaught if a cache file vanished between the
// readdir and the sort.

// This is the EXE axis, not the product axis (#1294), and the difference is the
// whole bug this function exists to close. tauri-bundler writes the bundle's
// binary under `mainBinaryName`, which this app leaves unset, so it is cargo's
// output — and for every build before #1562 that was `loomux` while the bundle
// around it was `Orrerix.app`. Windows never noticed, because `tasklist`'s
// IMAGENAME filter is case-insensitive and the old product spelling differed
// only in case; macOS's `pgrep -x` is not, so the guard matched nothing there
// and `update` was free to `rm -rf` a running /Applications bundle. Neither
// `Orrerix` nor `orrerix` vs `loomux` differs merely by case, so nothing
// case-insensitivity gives us covers this — the array does, or nothing does.
//
// Both binary spellings are asked about, not just the current one: an older
