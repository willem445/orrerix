// Pure, DOM-free core of the published-view staleness badge (#1608, plan
// #1600 §3 Phase 1). The DOM wiring lives in the views that render it —
// groupview.ts's header, tabbar.ts's strip — and everything that DECIDES
// anything is here so it is unit-testable under `node --test`, the same split
// as pollgate.ts / singleflight.ts / refreshgate.ts.
//
// WHAT THIS IS FOR — the silent freeze (#1604 review N3). #1602/#1604 made the
// blocking pool impossible to exhaust from the poll path by single-flighting
// both poll sites: a tick that finds its own previous call still outstanding
// skips instead of issuing another. That is the right liveness answer and it
// costs a disclosure. If the outstanding call NEVER settles — the stuck-lock
// case the gate exists for — the gate never clears and the panel keeps
// rendering its last payload forever: no badge, no timestamp, no toast. The
// human sees a group view that looks live and is not, which is worse than one
// that looks broken.
//
// Phase 1 removes the freeze at the source (a polled read now reads a
// published snapshot and cannot park) and this module is what makes the
// remaining case VISIBLE. A wedged registry parks exactly one thread — the
// publisher's — and every reader keeps answering with the last snapshot and a
// growing `age_ms`. Bounded, visible, recoverable: INV-6 applied to the
// registry.
//
// THE BADGE IS ENTERED ON THE CLOCK AND RELEASED ONLY ON EVIDENCE. The backend
// decides `stale` (from `age_ms > VIEW_STALE_AFTER_MS`, both computed
// backend-side at read time) and nothing clears it but the next successful
// publish, which is what re-stamps the payload. This module never runs a timer
// of its own and never decides staleness from the browser's clock: the two
// clocks disagree, and a badge that came down because a frontend timer expired
// would be exactly the "release on elapsed time rather than on independent
// evidence" failure `.orrerix/lessons.md` names.
//
// WHY `age_ms` RATHER THAN A TIMESTAMP DIFFERENCE. `meta.published_at_ms` is a
// wall-clock stamp carried for a human to read; `meta.age_ms` is measured
// backend-side from a MONOTONIC instant at the moment the read was served. A
// frontend subtracting `Date.now() - published_at_ms` would report a snapshot
// from the future after an NTP correction or a VM resume, and would silently
// bake the clock skew of every machine into the badge.
