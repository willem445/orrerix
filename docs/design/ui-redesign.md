# loomux's visual and experience design brief (#879)

This is the brief the whole redesign line is built to. Slice A ships the token layer and
this document; slices B through J restyle surfaces against it. Where a later slice and this
note disagree, one of them is wrong and it has to be settled here first.

Read it as an argument, not a spec sheet. Every value below exists because of a reason
stated next to it, and a reason you disagree with is a reason to change the value.

## What this is for

loomux runs a fleet of coding agents. On a busy day that is eight or ten terminals, most of
them working, one of them stuck, one of them finished and waiting on you. The job of the
chrome is one sentence: **tell the human which thread needs their hands, without ever
getting in front of the terminal that is doing the work.**

Everything here is downstream of that. The chrome is not the product; the panes are.

## The direction, and where it came from

The direction is set by the human, twice over. The issue names **ORCA** (onorca.dev) and
**T3 Code** (github.com/pingdotgg/t3code) as the target feel. A first proposal in a
different direction — a warm, undyed-flax ground — was **rejected at the direction gate**:
*"the UI color scheme is terrible. Not a fan of the yellowish black color. I'm looking for a
similar look and feel to ORCA + T3 … not just a color refresh but also a redesign on the
experience."* So this revision is neutral-ground, and it covers experience as well as colour.
(It was *cool*-neutral until #1320 took the last of the blue out; see §The palette.)

Six principles come out of the references — from their public pages, docs, public design
discussion, and a demo screenshot of ORCA the human supplied as the target:

1. **Chrome recedes; the work is the content.** Surfaces sit close together in luminance and
   separate by elevation and a hairline, not by heavy contrast blocks.
2. **Elevation is the organising idea.** Ground, panels, cards — and the surfaces that
   genuinely float say so with a radius and a shadow, while the ones that tile stay flat and
   tight. Depth carries "how close is this to me", so colour does not have to.
3. **Density is respect, with air.** Many agents' states at once, but rows get breathing
   room and sections get separation. Dense is not cramped.
4. **Structure is labelled, quietly.** Tiny letterspaced uppercase eyebrows over grouped
   content, small status chips on rows, machine strings in mono. The structure does the
   explaining so the copy does not have to.
5. **Colour is meaning, and every colour declares which meaning.** Status reads as small
   consistent colour signals rather than as boxy badge components. The first version of this
   principle went further — *if colour means state, nothing that is not state may take
   colour* — and that corollary is what made the result dull enough to be sent back. Colour
   also says *which thing this is*, which is the ORCA quality the human was pointing at. What
   is restrained is not the amount of colour but the discipline: three channels, each with
   its own positions (§The three colour channels).
6. **Supervision beats editing.** The question the UI answers is "what is happening, and
   where do I have to look", not "how do I edit this file".

**The no-copy line — binding on every slice of #879.** The references are studied for
principles only. No palette value, logo, layout signature, icon set, or distinctive
component from ORCA, T3 Code, or any other product may be lifted, traced, or approximated.
Every hex in this document was derived here; each was checked for zero occurrences in the
T3 Code source (`gh search code <hex> --repo pingdotgg/t3code`), and the check is recorded in
the PR. "Look and feel like ORCA" means *speak the same visual language*, and the sharpest
test of that is §The signature: the single most distinctive object in the reference is the
one thing this design may not reach for.

What this design takes from ORCA is one **principle**, stated so it can be checked: *colour
density carries identity — a tool can be richly coloured and still legible, provided each
colour is answering a declared question.* That principle is what §The three colour channels
implements. No ORCA hex, icon, or component was consulted for a value; the eight hues were
derived here and swept against the T3 Code source as above.

The same discipline applies to *themes*: the palette this replaces was Tokyo Night's, hex
for hex, in `TERM_THEME`. Borrowing a well-liked theme is how an app ends up with someone
else's identity and no argument for any of it.

## The palette — a slate ground and eight hues

Dark-only, and staying that way: `color-scheme: dark` on `:root` keeps native widgets
(select popups, scrollbars) dark, and a light theme would double every demo surface for a
product whose users work at night against terminals. The tokens make one *possible* later;
this line does not build one.

The ground is two neutral ramps, and it is **exactly what the direction gate approved** —
not one value has moved:

| Name | Value | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **slate** | `#0b0b0b` → `#393939` | the ground and the elevation ladder; every surface and border |
| **mist** | `#d2d2d2` / `#a3a3a3` / `#6d6d6d` | the ink: primary, secondary, faint |

**The ground carries no hue at all.** `B−R` is `0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0` across the slate ramp and
`0, 0, 0` across mist: every step is literally `r === g === b`. This *replaces* the earlier
cool-neutral ground, which leaned blue by 3 to 17 points as it climbed — read across a whole
window that came out as a blue cast on the chrome, which is what #1320 ask 1 asked to kill.

The ramp was not re-picked by eye. Relative luminance is 71.52% green, so collapsing each
old step to its own **green channel** yields a grey of nearly identical luminance: the whole
ladder moved by at most 1.4% (`slate200`, `slate300`, `slate500` and `mist000` by under
0.3%). Every contrast ratio, the elevation order, and the AA/AAA headroom the tests below
measure therefore survive the de-blueing unchanged — the hue left and nothing else did.

Achromatic is pinned as `r === g === b` rather than as a tolerance on how far blue may sit
above red, because a tolerance is a slope: it invites the next value to sit just inside it,
and eight steps each leaning two points the same way is a visible cast with no single step
tripping a threshold.

**The INTERACTION channel enters through the foreground only.** As of #1340 the accent — the
brand gold — paints marks, edges, rings and carets, and never a ground. That half of the old
rule is now measured rather than asserted; the guard is described below.

**It is not yet true of the palette as a whole, and this paragraph says so rather than
rounding up.** The state and identity channels still wash grounds, by design and with the
role table below sanctioning it — that table already lists "an awaiting-human task row" as a
`--state-*` consumer. Live examples at the commit this was measured on:
`.task-row.awaiting-human` is attention at 7% (12% on hover), `.decisions-card.urgent` at 8% over
`--surface-2`, `.diff-line.add`/`.del` jade and rose at 8%, `.tab.needs-attention` attention
at 10%, `.wf-blocked` danger at 8%. Of 388 `background`/`background-color` declarations below
`:root`, 25 carry the accent — all of them marks, all argued in the guard's allow-list — and
107 carry a `--state-*`/`--id-*`/`--cli-*` hue, most of those chips and pills rather than
grounds under content. (Counted as DECLARATIONS, not matching lines, with `@`-prelude rules
skipped; by matching lines the second figure is 110. The claim does not rest on which.)

Whether those washes are also part of what the human meant by *"any tint or hue applied to
everything"* is a product call made on screen, and #1340 is open for it. What must not happen
again is this paragraph claiming more than it measured — which is exactly how the previous
version of it read.

That previous version said the rule was "now literally true rather than nearly true", and it
was false the day it shipped. The gap is worth keeping written down because of the shape of
it. #1320 de-blued `slate` and `mist`, pinned `r === g === b` on every step of both, and in
the same slice handed `--selection` a deep **gold** wash (`#38321f`) — and `--selection` is a
ground: it is what sits under every selected file row, every open editor row, every active
workflow row, the find-panel chips, and every text selection in every terminal. Four chrome
rules did the same thing a different way, painting the accent straight into a `background`:
two icon-button hovers, the side dock's full-height resize grip, and the chosen decision
card's fill. The pin stayed green through all of it because its POPULATION stopped at the
ramp — the assertion was right and the list it ran over was short. That is what the human
saw: *"I don't like how the gold hue is tinting everything."*

`--selection` is now `#323232`, reached by the same method as the ramp — collapse to the
**green channel** (`0x32`), since luminance is 71.52% green — so all three contrasts the
token's level was set by survive: the fill stays visible on the app ground (1.478 → 1.473:1),
the ink stays readable on it (8.448 → 8.480:1), and so does the accent (8.159 → 8.191:1).
The four rules move from the accent to an `--ink` wash at the alpha whose blended luminance
matches the gold it replaces, so the *lift* is unchanged and only the pigment left.

**The accent may paint a mark, never a ground**, and that is now measured rather than
stated: `test/theme.test.ts` ("the accent paints marks, never grounds") scans every
`background`/`background-color` in the stylesheet and denies `var(--accent)` by default. The
twenty-five rules that keep it are enumerated with a reason each and fall into five kinds —
a drag affordance that only exists mid-gesture, a chip whose whole area *is* the mark, a
primary action, an on-state toggle, and a search match. A row whose rule stops painting an
accent background fails too, so the list cannot decay into exemptions for rules nobody kept.
Rings, edges, glyphs, carets and outlines are out of scope on purpose: those are the
positions the accent exists for.

Above the ground sit eight named hues, warm to cool around the wheel:

| Name | Value | Lit | Channels |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **rose** | `#e35a5a` | `#ee8080` | **state:** danger, error, deletions · identity |
| **amber** | `#e89c3c` | `#f2b45f` | **state:** attention — this one needs you · identity |
| **lime** | `#b5bf62` | `#cbd486` | identity only |
| **jade** | `#35a86b` | `#56c48c` | **state:** ok, done, additions · identity |
| **cyan** | `#5aa8b5` | `#7ec3ce` | identity only · ANSI cyan |
| **azure** | `#6f93c4` | `#95b3d8` | identity only · ANSI blue |
| **violet** | `#9a8fc4` | `#b7aed8` | identity only · ANSI magenta |
| **orchid** | `#c47f9e` | `#d8a2bb` | identity only |

Two pigments sit outside that table because they answer questions the eight do not:

| Name | Value | Channel |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **gold** | `#f8c93e` | **interaction:** the accent, the focus ring, the caret |
| **spring** | `#74d98d` | **state:** working / live |

The eight were also pulled down in chroma at #1320 ask 3 ("the pane icon colours are too
exotic"). `orchid` was a hot pink and is now a dusty rose, `violet` a lilac and is now a
slate-violet, `cyan` a bright cyan and is now a muted teal, `lime` a candy yellow-green and
is now brass. They remain eight distinct, AA-legible hues; they no longer read as candy
beside a near-black ground. The cost is measured and accepted below.

`cyan` and `violet` were terminal-only in the previous round — values that existed so the
sixteen ANSI slots stayed coherent, which no UI surface was allowed to touch. They are now
app hues, so the terminal and the chrome finally speak one palette instead of two. Only one
terminal-only value survives: ANSI green (`#57bd77`), because the app's greens are a teal
(jade) and a yellow-green (lime) and a CLI printing "green" means neither. `lime` and
`orchid` have no ANSI slot at all — app-only hues, the reverse of the old arrangement.

**Eight is a measurement, not a preference — and #1320 narrowed the margin.** The revision's
target was 8–10, and a ninth hue was tried in all three gaps the wheel still had; every
candidate landed closer to an existing hue than the eight-set's own closest pair. That
argument still holds, but the figure it quoted does not: the set's closest pair used to be
rose/orchid at 30.4 ΔE; after the #1320 de-exoticising, the eight's own closest pair
(azure/violet, 15.3 ΔE) is what a ninth candidate would now have to beat (CIE76). Pulling
four hues down in chroma moved them toward each other as well as toward the grey, and that
is the honest cost of the change.

15.3 ΔE is still far above a just-noticeable difference (~2.3) and these hues never carry
meaning alone — an identity hue is always accompanied by position, label and icon shape, and
the channel is *allowed* to collapse under CVD (below). But a future ninth hue can no longer
be refused by pointing at a 30 ΔE floor. If one is proposed, re-run the measurement rather
than quoting this paragraph.

The warm arc remains the crowded one, because two *state* dyes live there and neither may
move, so a third warm hue still costs exactly the state legibility the palette protects.

**The Lit step, and why there is no third value per hue.** Each hue carries one brighter
companion, used for the ANSI bright slots, for hover emphasis, and for chip text. There is
deliberately **no per-hue fill**: on a ground this dark a chip is the ground plus a hairline
in its hue, not a tinted block, so a fill token would be a third value per hue that nothing
paints. A slice that genuinely needs one mints it and pins it like everything else.

**One accent, and it is the brand gold.** `--accent` is `gold` (`#f8c93e`) — the orrery gold
off the logo, tempered a little off its `#ffc82a` core so a caret is not the brightest thing
on screen. It appears on the focus ring, the caret, the active tab and the primary action,
and nowhere else. It stays **one** colour however many hues the identity channel holds —
"what can I click" must never become a hue-matching exercise — and *sparingly* is part of
the token's meaning: gold on every surface is not an accent, it is a theme.

This reverses an earlier decision here, and the reversal is the point of #1320 ask 2. The
accent used to be `azure`, which was *also* `--state-working`, on the argument that "the
live thing and the thing the human is acting on are the same thing". They are not. A pane
can be working while the thing you may click is somewhere else entirely, and while one
pigment served both, the question "is this running, or is this what I can click?" had no
answer in colour — the two were not merely similar, they were the same hex. Form (edge
versus fill) was carrying a distinction that hue was actively denying.

Splitting them is also what makes ask 3 expressible: a gold accent only reads AS an accent
if the semantic scale beside it is something else. `test/theme.test.ts` ("the brand accent is
not a state dye") holds them apart at the state channel's own 9 ΔE floor under normal vision
and all three CVD simulations; the shipped margin is **12.8 ΔE** (tritan, against
`attention`, the nearest). On the pre-#1320 palette that same test measures **0.0**.

**Stopped agents get no dye.** `held` is faint mist and `idle` is a slate hairline. A held
agent is not running, so it carries no dye; it is marked by *form* — a dashed thread — not
by hue.

**Contrast is measured, not claimed.** `test/theme.test.ts` computes WCAG ratios over these
values on every run: primary ink clears AAA (7:1) on all four grounds, dim ink clears AA,
**every one of the eight hues clears AA (4.5:1) as text on every surface it can appear on** —
the worst case is rose at 4.61:1 on `--surface-2` — and each hue and its Lit step clear the
WCAG 1.4.11 non-text floor (3:1) on the terminal ground, where an icon or a badge can sit but
a label never does. Faint mist is *held* between 3:1 and 4.5:1, deliberately below AA,
because its role is non-essential meta. If a future edit makes faint ink readable, it has
stopped being a separate role and the test says so.

## The three colour channels

Colour in this app answers three different questions, and a surface that mixes them up is
the failure mode the whole token layer exists to prevent.

| Channel | Question it answers | Where it may appear |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **state** | what is this agent doing? | the **state positions** only: the warp thread, the status chip, the state dot |
| **interaction** | what can I act on? | focus ring, caret, active tab, primary action — one accent, nothing else |
| **identity** | *which* thing is this? | icon strokes and their role table, per-CLI marks (its own `--cli-*` sub-table — §The per-CLI hues), git-graph lanes, diff add/delete, task-board columns, workflow-mode chrome, project tabs, resource meters, the syntax sub-palette |

Identity is the channel this revision adds, and it is what makes the app colourful. It says
which *thing* you are looking at — a surface, an action family, a CLI, a git lane — as
opposed to what state that thing is in.

**Three hues carry both a state role and an identity role, and that is deliberate.** loomux
has one palette, not two. Minting a second near-identical pigment so an identity copy could
differ from a state copy is precisely the *"it needed a slightly different blue"* failure
rule 2 refuses. (Stated without a hue on purpose — it read "identity blue" versus "working
blue" until #1320 moved `working` off azure.) What separates the channels is **position**, not pigment: the state dyes hold
an exclusive claim to the state positions, and an identity hue may never enter one. Which
token a surface *names* — `--state-ok` or `--id-jade` — declares which question it is
answering, so a reviewer can see a channel violation in the diff without knowing a hex.

It was four until #1320. `azure` was the fourth, carrying `working` *and* the accent *and* an
identity role; it now carries identity and ANSI blue only, and `spring` — a state-only
pigment, in the channel but not in `IDENTITY` — took the live thread. `gold` is likewise
interaction-only. So the two pigments this revision added are each single-channel, which is
the shape the rule above actually wants: sharing is for hues that genuinely answer two
questions, not a way to avoid minting a value.

**The position rule is load-bearing, and here is the measurement that proves it.** Eight hues
on one dark ground cannot all survive colour-vision deficiency, and this set does not: under
simulation `azure`/`violet` are 0.0 ΔE to a protanope — genuinely identical — `cyan`/`azure`
are 2.4 ΔE to a tritanope, and `rose`/`orchid` are 4.3 ΔE to a tritanope. The design accepts
that for identity — which thing this is, is
always also carried by position, by a label, and by an icon's shape — and refuses it for
state, which is the one thing a supervisor must read correctly at a glance across ten panes.
The four state dyes stay well clear of each other under all three dichromacies (the worst
case is tritan `attention`/`danger`, where amber and rose both lose their yellow axis): the
state worst case is 10.8 ΔE, up from 10.3 before #1320. And the accent sits 12.8 ΔE from the
nearest state dye at its worst, where before #1320 it was 0.0 — it *was* that dye.
`test/theme.test.ts` asserts a floor of 9 on that, and separately refuses any identity-only
hue in a state role. So a supervisor who genuinely cannot tell violet from azure still reads
the fleet correctly — nothing they must act on was ever encoded in the channel that
collapsed.

That is also the answer to the risk this revision introduces: the control on fruit salad is
not "use fewer colours", it is that the colourful channel is never the load-bearing one.

## The icon system — a role, never a hue

The first *icon* surface to consume the identity channel — slice B (below) mapped the bulk
of the channel's other surfaces first — and the shape every later icon consumer should copy.
`src/icons.ts` is one registry; `test/icons.test.ts` holds it to everything below.

**Colour is assignment, not asset.** No icon carries a colour. The glyphs are `currentColor`
line art, the registry stamps `.ic-<role>` onto the `<svg>` it renders, and the stylesheet
maps each role to exactly one `var(--id-*)`. So recolouring the app never touches an SVG, and
a consumer cannot pick a hue — it picks a **meaning** and the table picks the hue. There is
deliberately no per-call override: rule 3 below allows an `--id-*` token only *through a
documented role mapping*, and an argument at the call site is precisely the ad-hoc route it
refuses.

**Eight roles, eight hues, one claim each.**

| Role | Token | The question it answers | Where it shows |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `workspace` | `--id-cyan` | where the work lives | folders, the cwd chip, the file actions |
| `source` | `--id-amber` | code you edit | source-file rows, the two ways into an editor |
| `content` | `--id-jade` | data and documents you read | config, markup, images, lockfiles, text |
| `vcs` | `--id-lime` | the repository's history | the branch chip, the git overlay |
| `fleet` | `--id-violet` | the agents themselves | group view, fold-group, and the per-pane agent mark of a CLI with no `--cli-*` hue |
| `board` | `--id-orchid` | the group's work surfaces | tasks, issues, audit, timeline |
| `danger` | `--id-rose` | destructive actions | delete |
| `live` | `--id-azure` | capture in progress | push-to-talk |

**The bijection is the discipline, and it is the answer to fruit salad at icon scale.** A hue
claimed by two roles has stopped saying *which thing this is* — the user sees amber and has to
work out whether it means source or tasks — and at that point the table has quietly become a
palette of nice colours. So each identity hue is claimed by exactly one role, checked both
ways. It also fixes the ceiling §The palette measured: a ninth icon family cannot arrive by
minting a ninth colour. It has to displace one, and argue why.

That ceiling binds the `--id-*` set and the *roles* that claim it, and the one set that has
ever been allowed past it went the other way round: the per-CLI hues (§The per-CLI hues) are
outside `--id-*` for exactly this reason — a CLI could not take a role's hue without giving
that hue a second meaning — and they buy their own pigments by only ever meeting each other,
in one position, rather than by joining this table.

**No icon role may name a `--state-*` token.** An icon that reports agent state takes its
colour from the *position* it sits in — the warp thread, the status chip, the state dot — not
from this registry. That is the position rule doing its work one layer down: `--state-danger`
and `--id-rose` are the same pigment, so the test checks the token a role *names*, never a
hex, and an icon dyed with a state token would look right, measure right, and still have moved
a fleet signal onto the channel that collapses under colour-vision deficiency.

**Hue groups, shape distinguishes.** The file tree is the densest icon surface in the app and
the one where this could most easily go wrong. Fifteen file categories share **three** roles —
folders, code you run, content you read — so a listing separates the kinds at a glance while
fifteen distinct glyphs separate the members. Fifteen hues down a two-hundred-row tree would
be noise; three is a legend.

**Vendored, not depended on.** The base set is [Lucide](https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide)
(ISC), copied verbatim as SVG-string constants at a pinned commit, with the licence and
provenance in `src/vendor/lucide/` and an entry in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`. Not an npm
package: the plan's no-new-dependency line holds, nothing in the build has to resolve an icon
package, and the copy stays small enough to audit — which is only true while **the set is
limited to icons a surface actually renders**, so a test walks `src/` and fails on one that
nothing asks for. The wrapper keeps Lucide's own `viewBox`, stroke weight, caps and joins, so
a re-vendor is a diff a reviewer can read against upstream. The alternatives were considered
and refused: hand-drawing fifty glyphs (the uneven set this replaced is the evidence), an icon
font (a webfont, with the flash of the wrong face §Type already rejects), and per-file `.svg`
assets through Vite (works, but string constants are what every consumer already takes and are
what keeps the registry node-testable).

### The second tier — brand marks, and the licence that decides whether one exists

One surface asks the registry a question it cannot answer: **which agent CLI is running in
this pane** (#992). The mark has to be a *brand*, because recognising Copilot is the entire
value — an abstract glyph loomux invented would say nothing a supervisor could read. That
puts it outside `src/icons.ts` on two counts, and `src/agenticons.ts` is where it lands.

**Why a second module rather than more rows.** `icon()` pins every body to `ICON_VIEWBOX` —
Lucide's 24 grid, stroked — and a vendored brand mark arrives on the grid its vendor drew it
on (`copilot-16` is a filled 16). Rescaling one onto the registry's grid would be exactly the
"do not restyle" rule above, broken; admitting a second grid into `icon()` would dissolve the
uniformity that makes a vendored set worth having. Two modules, one grid each, is the honest
shape.

**It started by borrowing `fleet`, and wave 2 gave it its own table instead.** An agent-type
glyph is the most literal possible member of *"the agents themselves"*, so the mark shipped
wearing `.ic-fleet` — which answers *is this an agent* and, it turned out, nothing else: with
three CLIs on screen every agent pane came out the same violet. §The per-CLI hues is the
answer and carries the full argument; what matters *here* is what it did and did not change
about this tier:

- **The mark now reaches its colour through `.cli-<program>`** when its program is on the hue
  roster, and `.ic-fleet` when it is not — one class or the other, never both. Violet no
  longer means *this is an agent*; it means *an agent loomux has no brand hue for*.
- **The bijection above still survives untouched**, which was the real content of the original
  claim. `--cli-*` is a separate token set precisely *because* each `--id-*` hue is claimed by
  exactly one icon role, so no CLI takes a role's meaning. What is no longer true is the "no
  ninth colour" half: there are eight more pigments, in their own sub-table, argued in §The
  per-CLI hues on the ground that they meet only each other.
- **`test/icons.test.ts` does not cover these marks for free**, and never quite did — its
  both-directions scan reads bare `.ic-<role>` rules, so `.cli-*` was always outside it. The
  three-surface roster pin in `test/agenticons.test.ts` is what holds the CLI table (renderer
  ↔ `CSS_TOKENS` ↔ stylesheet), and the `.ic-*` scan carries a note that the `.cli-*` block
  beside it is deliberately *not* the overriding selector its own caveat warns about.
- **Shape groups, hue distinguishes** — the inverse of the file tree one layer up. Every agent
  mark is a 16-grid mark or badge, which is what makes them read as one channel; the hue says
  *which CLI*, and the glyph carries it redundantly wherever a licence or a distinct initial
  allows.

**Two tiers, because a licence is not always available.** A vendored mark needs **two**
permissions, and only one of them is what an OSS licence talks about:

- **Copyright in the artwork**, which a project can grant over its own glyph. Primer Octicons
  is MIT, from GitHub, over GitHub's `copilot-16` — granted outright.
- **Trademark in the mark**, which no OSS licence grants and which is not needed for
  *nominative* use: drawing the Copilot mark on a pane that is running Copilot is the mark
  identifying the thing it names. That permission survives only while the artwork is
  **unmodified** and no affiliation is implied, which is why the vendoring rules here are the
  strictest in the codebase.

A CLI whose vendor grants neither — Claude and opencode today — therefore gets tier two: a
**generated letter badge**, a rounded rect around the program's first character. This is a
refusal, not a gap. A hand-traced lookalike is a derivative of a mark with no grant behind it,
and a third-party icon aggregator's CC0 covers the aggregator's *tracing*, not the trademark
it traces; neither is a permission, and shipping one would be the practice #992 was written to
avoid.

**The fallback is total, and that is the design.** loomux gains CLIs faster than vendors
publish brand kits, so the resolver never asks *"is this one of ours"* — a fixed roster would
make the next CLI a user launches the one pane with no mark, which is the pane they most need
to find. It asks *"does this program have a mark, and if not, what letter is it"*. Adding a
CLI is a table row when a licensed glyph exists and **no change at all** when it doesn't.

**It refuses to guess, which is the other half.** No launch command resolves to *nothing
drawn* — a plain shell is not an agent, and a neutral badge on every terminal is noise dressed
as information. An unreadable program name resolves to `?`, which reads as "loomux does not
know" and is true. The prior art #992 cites coerced unidentified panes to a default brand and
had to undo it: a wrong mark is strictly worse than no mark, because a reader takes it as an
answer.

**The launch line is not always evidence, which is where that principle nearly died.** An
#887 SSH pane's child process is the local ssh client, so its `argv[0]` is `ssh` — and the
agent, if any, runs on the far end where argv cannot reach it. Read naively, that produced a
confident, specific, wrong caption ("Agent CLI: ssh") on panes that were running Claude:
exactly the failure the paragraph above claims does not happen, arrived at through a route
nobody had thought to check. Two rules came out of it, and both generalise past SSH:

- **Prefer what loomux already knows over what it can infer.** The pane's SSH profile names
  the far-end CLI (`defaultCli`), and that is the program the remote command was actually
  composed from — an authoritative answer sitting one field away from a guessed one. It is
  threaded to the pane by the callers that hold the profile, because resolving it later
  costs an async store read the header cannot wait for.
- **A caption is a claim, so the neutral tier must not carry one.** Where nothing
  authoritative exists, the mark degrades to `?` labelled *"agent CLI unknown"* — never to
  the transport's own initial, and never to an "Agent CLI:" caption. The denylist that
  enforces this is a list of *transports and shells*, never an allowlist of agents: an
  allowlist would quietly undo the total fallback above.

**The generated tier is a clamp, not an escape.** Its one variable byte comes from a launch
command — human-typed, or supplied by a workflow file — and the result is injected with
`innerHTML` in a webview that can reach the IPC bridge. So the badge admits one character and
only if it is `[A-Z0-9]`, else `?`. Nothing else is expressible, so there is nothing to
escape, and the rule cannot decay into "we escaped the characters we thought of".

### The per-CLI hues — `--cli-*`, and why they could not be `--id-*`

The mark above answers *which CLI is this* in **shape**. Until wave 2 it answered it in
**colour** not at all: every agent mark took the `fleet` role's `--id-violet`, which is the
right answer to *is this an agent* and no answer to *which one*. The human's note on the
wave-2 demo was the predictable consequence — a wall of panes running three different CLIs
came out one colour, so the glyph had to be read rather than seen, which is the opposite of
what the mark is for. Purple everywhere.

**The obvious fix is the one the bijection forbids.** Handing opencode `--id-jade` and claude
`--id-amber` costs nothing to write and quietly destroys the thing that makes eight hues
legible: each identity hue is claimed by exactly *one* icon role (§The icon system), so jade
would no longer resolve to `content` — it would mean "content, or opencode, work it out from
where you saw it". That is the failure the bijection exists to prevent, arrived at from the
inside. So a per-CLI hue needs a pigment no role has claimed, which means a new set, which
means a new prefix:

| CLI | Token | Value | What it leans on |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **claude** | `--cli-claude` | `#e08a5f` | Anthropic's warm terracotta |
| **codex** | `--cli-codex` | `#3ec2a8` | OpenAI's green |
| **copilot** | `--cli-copilot` | `#7fa8d8` | GitHub's blue |
| **opencode** | `--cli-opencode` | `#5fc873` | — loomux's own pick |
| **gemini** | `--cli-gemini` | `#9677c5` | Gemini's blue-violet |
| **hermes** | `--cli-hermes` | `#b67c94` | — loomux's own pick |
| **ante** | `--cli-ante` | `#c3c455` | — loomux's own pick |
| **pi** | `--cli-pi` | `#00d2f0` | — loomux's own pick |

**Evocation, never replication.** Not one value above is a vendor's own hex, and none is
presented as one. Leaning a pigment toward a brand's family is the same nominative use that
lets loomux draw GitHub's own glyph for a pane running GitHub Copilot (§The second tier);
*copying* a trademark colour exactly would be a claim of affiliation loomux does not make and
does not need. Four of the eight have no vendor colour identity to lean on at all, so they
were picked outright, for separation and nothing else — and the table says so rather than
implying an association that isn't there.

**This is the identity channel, not a fourth one.** *Which CLI is this* is the identity
question by definition — §The three colour channels already lists per-CLI marks as an
identity consumer. `--cli-*` is a **sub-table** of that channel for one closed roster, and it
inherits the channel's rules whole: the state positions stay reserved, and a `--cli-*` token
may no more enter one than an `--id-*` token may. `test/theme.test.ts` counts `--cli-*` as
identity in the position-mixing check, so that is measured rather than asserted.

**Eight more pigments does not reopen "eight is a measurement".** That ceiling (§The palette)
was measured for hues that must be told apart *across the whole app*, where a ninth candidate
landed closer to an existing hue than the eight-set's own closest pair (azure/violet,
15.3 ΔE). These eight never face that comparison: they appear in exactly **two positions** —
the agent mark and the session list's CLI chip — and only ever against each other. Measured
on their own terms they remain legible, closest pair **31.5 ΔE** (codex/opencode) — a
comparison that *reversed* at #1320, since the octet they are measured against is now the
looser of the two (see `theme.ts` §CLI_HUES) — and
the test derives the bar from `IDENTITY`'s own closest pair rather than hard-coding it, so
eight extra pigments stay justified only while they remain the more legible set.

pi (#2126) is the eighth, and it did **not** move that 31.5: its nearest neighbours are codex
at 31.7 and copilot at 32.2, so `codex`/`opencode` is still the pair the number names. It is
also the brightest of the eight, and that is forced rather than chosen — the one hue region
the other seven leave empty is cyan-through-blue, whose muted middle is crowded by codex's
teal and copilot's steel, so every candidate below L\* ≈ 74 there lands inside the 30 ΔE
floor. A tempered `#4ccfe8` measures 28.5 ΔE from copilot and is therefore not available.

> Every ΔE in this section is CIE76 over the Viénot LMS dichromat simulation in
> `test/theme.test.ts` — the same code the suite runs, and the only method quoted anywhere in
> this feature. Two surfaces disagreeing because one of them measured differently is a class
> of error, not a rounding.

**Colour-vision deficiency — and the worst case is tritan, not the red-green ones.** Eight
hues on one dark ground do not survive CVD and these do not. Closest pair per simulation:

| Simulation | Closest pair | ΔE |
| --- | --- | --- |
| protan | copilot/pi | 14.2 |
| deutan | copilot/pi | 8.6 |
| tritan | codex/copilot | **1.4** |

The first two rows are pi's arrival rather than a regression it caused: before it they read
`opencode`/`ante` 15.6 and `codex`/`hermes` 9.5, and pi takes both over by a little. Neither
is a collapse, and `copilot`/`pi` is the safest shape pairing on the roster — the vendored
octicon against a letter `P`.

1.4 ΔE is the honest headline: a tritanope sees codex and copilot as *one colour*. That is
the same trade identity already makes and states — *which thing this is* is always also
carried by position, label and **shape**. Here the shape is usually a single letter, so the
trade holds only while no two CLIs draw the same one; where two do, colour is the last
channel left and has to survive what the others are excused from.

The roster has three CLIs starting with `C`, and exactly one pair where colour is the **only**
remaining channel: `claude`/`codex`, both badging a plain `C` (`copilot` draws the vendored
octicon, so it is shape-distinct). Its worst view is **25.1 ΔE** (protan; deutan 42.2, tritan
135.4), against a floor of 15. And every pair that *does* collapse is shape-distinct —
codex/copilot is a `C` against the octicon, copilot/pi (8.6, deutan) the octicon against a
`P`. The test computes the collision set *from the renderer* rather than listing it, so a
further CLI starting with `C` inherits the obligation the day it is added.

**Distance from the neutrals, not just from each other.** The first copilot candidate was a
pewter (`#93a8c4`) chosen to evoke GitHub's monochrome mark. It cleared AA on every ground and
sat well clear of all six other CLI hues — and **8.7 ΔE** from `--ink-dim`, which is the
colour of the header text the mark is drawn beside. It would have read as an *undyed* mark,
i.e. as the exact bug this table exists to fix, on the CLI most likely to be running. The
shipped set is held 20 ΔE clear of every step of the ink ramp, with 20.6 (copilot/`--ink-dim`)
the closest it comes.

**One CLI, one answer, everywhere.** The session list already dyed its CLI chips — claude
amber, copilot azure, opencode jade — so loomux had two colour tables for one question, and a
Copilot chip was the same azure as the *orchestrator role* chip beside it on the same row.
Those three rules now name `--cli-*`, and `test/theme.test.ts` checks both surfaces against
the table the way it already does for the four agent roles.

**Either the CLI's class or the fleet's, never both.** `src/agenticons.ts` stamps
`cli-<program>` on a mark whose program is on the roster and `ic-fleet` on one that is not, so
no `.cli-*` rule ever has to out-specify `.ic-fleet` — a mark that wore both would take
whichever block sat lower in `styles.css`, a pin held by source order alone. A CLI with no hue
keeping the fleet violet is also the honest answer rather than a gap: loomux gains CLIs faster
than it gains a considered pigment for each, and violet reads as *"an agent loomux has no
brand hue for"* — the colour twin of the letter badge's own total fallback.

**The roster is a closed list, which is also the injection answer.** The dye now puts a
program-derived token into a `class` attribute inside a string injected with `innerHTML`, and
`program` comes off a launch line. Interpolating it would put `"><img src=x onerror=…>` into
the markup two attributes to the left of the clamp that makes the letter tier safe. Only a
name that *matches* the roster is ever interpolated, so what reaches the attribute is one of
eight compile-time strings — the same discipline as the clamp: make the hostile value
unexpressible rather than escaped.

**What this deliberately does not do: the glyphs.** Wave 2 changes the marks' colour and
nothing about their shape. Whether claude, opencode and the rest should have drawn glyphs
rather than letter badges is the licensing question §The second tier answers, and it is
tracked separately (#992) — a hue needs no licence, so it could ship now; a glyph cannot, so
it did not.

## Elevation — the model, not a decoration

Four surfaces, one ladder, and the rule that governs it: **height means "closer to the
human".**

| Level | Token | What sits here |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ground | `--surface-term` | terminal canvases — the deepest thing on screen |
| 0 | `--surface-0` | the app ground behind everything |
| 1 | `--surface-1` | panels, bars, headers, the rail |
| 2 | `--surface-2` | cards, inputs, hovered rows, popovers |

The steps between them are tiny by measurement — 1.041, 1.055 and 1.087:1 — because
principle 1 says surfaces separate by elevation and a hairline, not by a slab;
`test/theme.test.ts` fails a surface step above 1.3:1. The two border steps above the ramp
deliberately open up (1.146:1 and 1.245:1), because an edge that nobody can see is not doing
the separating the surfaces are refusing to do.

**The project-tab strip is where the ladder had to be spent rather than named** (wave 2). The
strip was flat and, in one place, inverted: `#tab-bar` and an inactive `.tab` were both
`--surface-1`, so an unselected tab had no body at all and its hairline was standing in for
one; and `.tab.active` was `--surface-term`, which made the tab you are actually in the
darkest thing on screen. That is the model read backwards, and it did not buy the browser-tab
continuity that would justify it — the bar's own bottom hairline runs straight across
underneath, and the workspace below is `--surface-0`, not `--surface-term`. The strip now
spends one step per state: the bar is the deepest surface (a recessed trough, and a clean
step down from `#topbar`'s gradient above it), idle is the app ground, hover is the panel
step, and the active tab is the raised step with the strong border and its accent edge. What
`test/theme.test.ts` pins is the *relationship* — a tab is never the bar's own colour, and
the tab you are in is the highest surface in the strip — so re-tuning stays legal and
re-flattening does not.

Shadows are the second half of the model and they are rationed: `--shadow-card` for a raised
object, `--shadow-float` for one that genuinely floats over the work. **Neither may sit under
permanent chrome** — a shadow under a bar that is always there is decoration — and **no large
soft shadow may be composited over a terminal**, which is the documented way to make this app
slow (`docs/design/performance.md`). The terminal is the one surface with no elevation at all:
it is the floor.

## Type

Two roles, both system-resident. **No webfont is vendored, and that is an argument, not a
default.**

- `--font-ui` — `"Segoe UI Variable Text", "Segoe UI", system-ui, sans-serif`. Labels,
  titles, prose, buttons: everything a person wrote.
- `--font-mono` — `"Cascadia Code", "Cascadia Mono", Consolas, "Courier New", monospace`.
  **Machine identifiers only**: paths, branches, agent ids, model names, counts, timings,
  keycaps. The rule is what makes it work — wherever the mono face appears, it means "this is
  a literal string the machine gave you", so the eye can skip it or trust it accordingly.

Vendoring a characterful OFL face is the obvious move for "make it look designed", and this
brief still refuses it: the window paints before the bundle exists (see §Pinning), so a
webfont buys a flash of the wrong face on every cold start, on a surface whose whole job is
to recede. The character comes from the *treatment* instead — the eyebrow.

**The eyebrow** is the structural device this design commits to: a 10px uppercase label at
`0.09em` tracking in faint mist, sitting over a group of content, with no rule and no box.
It is how sections announce themselves without chrome, and it is the reason the boards and
the cards can drop most of their borders. Section labels are nouns and never sentences.

Sizes are roles: `--text-eyebrow` 10px, `--text-xs` 10.5px (meta, keycaps), `--text-s`
11.5px (chrome labels, tabs, buttons), `--text-m` 13px (prose), `--text-l` 15px (surface
titles), `--text-xl` 22px (the one big numeral a stat tile is allowed). The terminal stays at
14px / 1.1 line-height, unchanged, because cell metrics are the one typographic knob that
moves a pane's geometry.

Windows 10 is the baseline. Segoe UI Variable is Windows 11-only and the Cascadia faces ship
with Windows Terminal and Visual Studio rather than with the OS — both chains fall through to
a face that is on every supported Windows (Segoe UI, Consolas). Neither chain may lose its
fallback.

## Shape and rhythm

Radius says whether a thing is an *object* or part of a *list*: `--radius-s` 6px for chips
and inputs, `--radius-m` 10px for panels and cards, `--radius-l` 14px for surfaces that
float, and `--radius-pill` for status chips. Rows, bars and pane frames stay square — they
tile, and a tiled thing with rounded corners reads as a mistake.

Spacing is a 4px rhythm (`--space-1..7`, 4/6/8/12/16/24/32) and it is where "density with
air" is actually spent: rows get vertical space, groups get `--space-6` between them, and
cards get `--space-7` inside.

```

- **The grid is the content** and takes every pixel it can.
- **Overlays are overlays.** Git view, task board, audit, issues, file manager and the
  session browser open *over* the grid and close again. No overlay becomes a split, and no
  overlay changes a pane's size: panes have exactly one geometry authority and it is the pane
  system (#885), not the chrome. This is `CLAUDE.md` constraint 1, and it is not a limitation
  to design around — it is what keeps scrollback intact.
- **One bar at the bottom, not two** (X9), and **a rail on the left if it earns its place**
  (X10). Both are experience changes, specified below rather than assumed here.

## The signature — the warp

One signature element, and the argument for keeping it through a change of visual language.

**The selvedge.** Every pane frame carries a 2px vertical thread down its left edge,
continuing through the pane header. Its colour is the pane's live agent state — spring
working, amber needs-you, jade done, rose failed, dashed faint mist held, a slate hairline
idle. Because panes tile side by side, the threads of adjacent panes stand parallel across
the whole grid: the fleet's state *is* a warp, read left to right, without a single badge.

**Why it survives the redirect.** The temptation, given "make it feel like ORCA", is to
reproduce the most distinctive object in the reference — its floating overview card with the
big stat numerals. That is precisely what the no-copy line forbids, and it is the right
prohibition: a borrowed signature is how you end up with someone else's identity again, which
is the mistake the Tokyo Night palette already made here. So loomux needs its own device *in
ORCA's language*, and the warp is native to loomux in a way it could not be to the reference:
ORCA lists workspaces in a rail, while loomux **tiles live terminals**, and a vertical state
edge only resolves into one picture if the things carrying it are tiled. It costs no colour
budget (it *is* the state colour), no space, and no geometry.

**If the rail ships (X10), the rail carries the aggregate view** — one thread per agent row,
in the same colours, so the rail and the grid read as the same warp at two scales. Until
then, a short strip of threads beside the version badge in the top bar's left slot (#1351)
does that job. The strip is a fallback, not a second signature; if the rail lands, the strip
goes.

Three rules keep it safe and one keeps it honest:

- **The thread's width is constant** (`--thread: 2px`) and only its colour changes. A state
  change may never alter a size. It is the only weight in the app that is not the hairline
  (`--line-w: 1px`) — two weights, and no third.
- **It is drawn as a positioned pseudo-element, never as a border in the pane's box**, so the
  frame's geometry is untouched and the thread cannot cost a reflow or a ConPTY resize.
- **No blur or `backdrop-filter` near a pane.** The stylesheet has exactly one today — the
  cold-boot restore splash, shown before any pane exists, so it never composites over a WebGL
  canvas. It is the only one, and a slice that adds a second is wrong.
- **One animation exists in this app**: an attention thread pulses its opacity, slowly, and
  only while an agent is actually waiting on the human. It stops when acknowledged and does
  not run under `prefers-reduced-motion`. Everything else animates on state change only.

## The experience redesign

The human widened the ask past colour, so this section proposes the experience in the new
language. **None of it is built in slice A.** Each item is either mapped to a slice the plan
already has, or flagged **NEW-SLICE-NEEDED** for the orchestrator to take back to plan-380 —
the two flagged items change behaviour or geometry, which is not a restyle and must not be
smuggled into one.

| # | Change | Lands in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| X1 | The elevation model applied: every surface assigned a level, shadows only on floating ones | **B** |
| X2 | Radii, spacing rhythm and the eyebrow applied across the stylesheet | **B** |
| X3 | Tab bar quieted: status as a dot, close on hover, chips only where the word is the information | **C** |
| X4 | Pane header goes two-tier: agent name in sans, path and branch in dim mono, state moves to the thread | **D** |
| X5 | The dock reads as a row of status chips rather than mini-windows | **D** |
| X6 | Boards (task, audit, timeline) adopt eyebrow + card, losing most of their borders | **E** |
| X7 | A status-chip primitive in the shared kit — dot, label, one subtle fill — used by C, D, E, F | **G** |
| X8 | Welcome, restore and session surfaces become floating cards with a stat tile row | **F** |
| X9 | The two bottom bars collapse into one; keyboard hints become on-demand | **NEW-SLICE-NEEDED** |
| X10 | A left rail organising workspaces and the agent roster | **NEW-SLICE-NEEDED** |

### X9 — one bar at the bottom, not two

Today the app spends two full-width strips on chrome that never changes: `#hintbar` carries
**eleven** keyboard shortcuts plus a usage tip, and `#statusbar` carries four resource
meters. Stacked on top of
the top bar and the tab bar, that is four horizontal bands of chrome around the work. The
hints are valuable in week one and noise thereafter, and they are the band that earns the
least.

Proposal: one bottom bar carrying the resource meters, with the hints moved behind a `?`
affordance at its right edge — a quiet, permanent entry point to the full list, rather than
the list itself. This is **NEW-SLICE-NEEDED** because it removes a surface people currently
learn from: it needs a discoverability answer (does the overlay appear on first run? is there
a first-run state at all?), and that is a product decision, not a restyle.

### X10 — the rail, and whether loomux should have one

ORCA organises around a left rail: workspaces, then grouped lists of work with status chips.
It is the most legible thing about it, and the honest question is whether loomux's model
wants one.

**The case for.** loomux's fleet is currently legible only as tabs plus whatever panes happen
to be on screen; agents in other tabs, minimised, or docked are invisible until you go
looking. A rail listing every agent with its state — the same warp colours — would answer
"what is happening and where do I have to look" in one glance, which is principle 6.

**The case against, and it is real.** loomux already has a left panel, and it is a warning
rather than a precedent: `#sessions` is an in-flow flex sibling of the grid at `width: 344px`
with a `0.24s` width **transition**, so opening it shrinks the grid — refitting every pane and
resizing every ConPTY behind it. That was once per pane *per frame of the animation* until
#1149 coalesced the fit burst (`src/resizeburst.ts`) down to once per pane per toggle; the
per-frame layout work is unchanged, and one resize per pane is the floor a displacing panel
can reach. That is the PTY-resize cost constraint 1 exists to prevent, and the recommendation
below is unaffected — a rail that toggles would still repeat the mistake at higher frequency.

**What #1150 changed about that argument, and what it did not.** The app now has a *second*
displacing panel: the side dock moved from an overlay into the flex row at the human's
direction, so opening it autosizes the open panes (docs/design/side-dock.md). That settles the
question of whether a displacing panel is permissible — it is, once #1149 made the price one
coalesced resize per pane per toggle instead of fifteen — but it does not weaken the
recommendation below, and the reason is the word *toggles*. A dock toggle is a click whose
whole purpose is to change how much room the terminals get. A rail's width changing is chrome
moving for its own reasons, and the cost scales with how often that happens.

**Recommendation.** A rail, yes — but a **persistent, fixed-width** one that is part of the
app frame and never animates its width, so the geometry cost is paid once at startup like any
other version change. It should *replace* work the tab bar is doing rather than add a second
navigation system beside it. Both of those are structural decisions with geometry
consequences, which makes this **NEW-SLICE-NEEDED** and a coordination point with **#885**,
who owns everything that changes a pane's size. `--rail-w` is reserved in the token layer so
the decision has a single place to live; nothing consumes it yet.

## Self-critique — what was revised, and away from what

**Round 1 is the most useful thing in this section, because it failed.** The
`frontend-design` skill names three looks AI-generated design falls into; the app was in the
second (near-black, one bright accent), so the first proposal moved *away* from all three —
a warm undyed-flax ground, no chrome accent at all, textile vocabulary throughout. It was
internally coherent, it was not a default, and the human rejected it in one line: the
yellowish black was disliked, and what they wanted was the reference language they had named
in the issue from the start.

The lesson is not "be more generic". It is that **avoiding the defaults is not the goal;
serving the brief is** — and the skill says so explicitly: where the brief pins a direction,
the brief's own words win, *including* when they ask for one of the named defaults. Round 1
spent its originality on the axis the human had already fixed (the palette family) and had
none left for the axis they actually cared about (the experience). This revision inverts
that: the palette family is the reference's, and the originality is spent on structure — the
elevation model, the eyebrow, the state discipline, and a signature the reference cannot
have.

Three specific things were revised away:

**The warm ground is gone, entirely.** It was first inverted — `B−R` positive at every step of
the slate ramp where the old one was negative at every step — and then, at #1320, neutralised
outright: `B−R` is now `0` at every step. See §The palette, which is the current statement.

**The no-accent position was softened to one restrained accent.** Round 1 abolished the
chrome accent to make the state dyes mean something; the human asked for restrained accent
usage, not none, and a UI with no interactive colour at all makes "what can I click" a
guessing game. The scarcity argument is preserved a cheaper way: one accent, reused from the
state palette rather than added to it, with form separating the two meanings. #1320 reversed
the *reuse* half of that: the accent is now `gold`, a pigment of its own, because sharing one
hex with `--state-working` made "running" and "clickable" the same colour. The scarcity
argument survives — there is still exactly one accent.

**The textile vocabulary is gone.** Round 1 named its palette fibre, linen, indigo, saffron,
verdigris and madder. In a plain grey cockpit those words would be a costume — and dressing a
motif in vocabulary rather than in structure is the exact failure round 1's own critique
identified in *its* first draft. The names are now plain (slate, mist, azure, amber, jade,
rose) and the loom idea survives only where it does structural work: the warp, which encodes
the tiling geometry, and nothing else.

The accessory removed at the end: the top-bar thread strip, which becomes a fallback rather
than a second home for the signature the moment the rail exists.

### Round 3 — the direction was right and the result was dull

Round 2 passed the direction gate and came back with one word attached: **too dull**. That
was correct, and the useful part is *why*, because it was not a mistake in any hex.

**The dullness was a rule, not a palette.** Round 2's maintainability rule 3 read: chrome
takes slate and mist, and a surface gets a dye only if it is reporting an agent state. With
four dyes rationed to four states, that rule made near-monochrome the *only* legal outcome —
there was no amount of taste that could add colour without breaking it. Round 2 had even
written the corollary down as a principle and been pleased with it. So the rule changed, not
the ground: the identity channel (§The three colour channels) is a third legitimate reason
for a surface to take hue, and the palette grew from four app dyes to eight named hues.

**This is round 1's lesson arriving a second time, in a new disguise.** Round 1 spent its
originality on the axis the human had fixed (the palette family). Round 2 did something
subtler and just as wrong: it took a *principle it had derived itself* — colour is state,
therefore nothing else may have colour — and let it outrank the thing the human actually
asked for, which was to look like ORCA. ORCA is colourful. A rule that forbids the reference's
most obvious quality is a rule that has stopped serving the brief, and the tell was that
round 2 could describe its own result as "restrained" instead of noticing it was drab.

**The named risk flips: from dull to fruit salad.** Eight hues in a supervision tool can
absolutely destroy the legibility this app exists for, and that is now the real danger. Three
things answer it, and they are checkable rather than tasteful:

- **Position, not pigment, separates the channels.** State positions are reserved; identity
  may never enter one. So more colour cannot dilute the signal a supervisor reads.
- **The collapse is measured, not hoped for.** The eight-hue set genuinely fails under
  colour-vision deficiency, and the design places nothing load-bearing on it — the four state
  dyes stay far apart under all three dichromacies — the state worst case is 10.8 ΔE — and
  the test enforces a floor of 9.
- **Eight is where the measurements stopped, not where enthusiasm stopped.** Every candidate
  ninth hue was closer to a neighbour than the set's own tightest pair, so it was refused.

**The nearest remaining risk, named honestly.** The palette still sits inside the skill's
default look #2 — a near-black ground with saturated accents — which is where the app
started, and adding hues does not by itself buy an identity. What keeps it from being the
templated version of itself is the *discipline*: three declared channels rather than one bag
of accent colours, depth rather than colour carrying hierarchy, structure (eyebrows, chips,
the warp) doing the work decoration usually does, and a signature the reference cannot have.
A reviewer who wants to falsify that should look for an `--id-*` token in a state position;
that is the single failure that would collapse the whole argument, and it is the one the
tests refuse.

**What is still unproven.** Every claim above is about eight values and their measured
relationships. Whether the app *feels* more alive is a question about surfaces, and slice A
paints none of them — the hues are reserved in the token layer and nothing consumes one yet.
That is exactly what the human's look at this PR is for, and it is why the honest answer to
"is it colourful now?" is: the rule that prevented it is gone, and slice B onward is where it
becomes visible.

## Maintainability rules — binding on slices B through J

1. **No raw colour outside the token block in `src/styles.css`.** Surfaces consume semantic
   tokens. Slice B migrates the literals that predate this rule and lists any documented
   exception in its PR.
2. **No new colour without a role.** A colour that is not one of the eight names, in one of
   the declared roles, does not go in. "It needed a slightly different blue" is the failure
   mode the token layer exists to prevent.
3. **Every coloured surface declares its channel.** Colour answers one of three questions —
   state, interaction, or identity (§The three colour channels) — and the token a surface
   names is how it says which. **The state positions** (the warp thread, the status chip, the
   state dot) take `--state-*` and nothing else; **the accent** stays the one interaction
   colour; **everything else** that wants hue takes an `--id-*` token *through a documented
   role mapping*, never ad hoc. Structural chrome — surfaces, bars, rules, body text — is
   still slate and mist: identity colours the things being *identified*, not the frame around
   them.
4. **State changes colour, never size.** No hover, focus, or attention style may change a
   pane's box, `.xterm` padding, or terminal font metrics — those move cell geometry
   (`docs/design/xterm-resize-reflow.md`) and belong to #885.
5. **Shadows only on surfaces that float**, never under permanent chrome, and never a large
   soft shadow over a terminal. No blur or `backdrop-filter` beyond the one existing
   exception.
6. **`color-scheme: dark` stays on `:root`.** Dropping it regresses native widget colours
   silently.
7. **The three colour surfaces move together.** See the next section.

## Pinning — one palette, three languages

loomux's colours have to exist in three places that cannot read each other:

- `:root` in `src/styles.css`, which styles the chrome;
- the critical `<style>` block in `index.html`, which paints the app ground *before* the
  bundle exists (without it, startup flashes an unstyled white page);
- the xterm.js `ITheme`, because terminals render on a WebGL canvas that CSS custom
  properties never reach.

`src/theme.ts` is the one copy. It is DOM-free so `node --test` can import it directly, and
`test/theme.test.ts` reads the other two surfaces off disk and fails if either drifts: the
stylesheet must declare every pinned token with theme.ts's value, `index.html` must paint
exactly `PRE_PAINT_BACKGROUND`, and `pane.ts` must contain no colour literal at all.

The stylesheet pin runs **both ways**, which matters most on slice B: theme.ts → stylesheet
catches a token that drifts, and stylesheet → theme.ts catches a token *minted* in `:root`
with a literal value, which would be a fourth copy created by the very slice that is supposed
to be removing copies. A `var(...)` value is an alias onto something already pinned, so the
legacy bridge passes without exception; the one bridge declaration that is a literal
(`--accent-glow`) is named in the test and dies with the bridge. The guard covers
declarations whose *value is a colour* — a colour embedded inside a composite value, such as
the alpha-black in a shadow token, is not reached by it, which is why shadow tokens are
alpha-black only and are declared in this block where a reader can see all of them at once.

The sixteen ANSI slots are additionally checked present, pairwise distinct, and legible
against the terminal ground — sixteen near-identical hex strings is the exact shape a
copy-paste typo hides in, and a collapsed slot would make some CLI's output invisible with no
error anywhere.

Build-time codegen from CSS to TS was considered and rejected: it is a build step plus a
generated file to review, for one shared seam that a test and a comment already hold.

## What slice A shipped, and what it did not

Shipped: this note, `src/theme.ts`, the semantic token layer in `:root` — including the eight
`--id-*` identity tokens — `TERM_THEME` derived from `theme.ts`, the `index.html` pre-paint
sync, and `test/theme.test.ts`.

**Slice A reserved the identity tokens rather than consuming them**, the same way `--rail-w`
is declared and unused: its job was to make the decision once, in a place the later slices
could point at. **Slice B is the first surface to consume the channel** — it maps the bulk of
the app's surfaces onto the eight `--id-*` tokens (§What slice B migrated, below). Slice K adds
the icon role→dye table (§The icon system) on top of that map — claiming all eight hues again,
this time across the pane headers, the file toolbars and every row of the file trees — the
channel's first *icon* consumer, not its first consumer.

Not shipped: any restyling — and the honest description of that is not "the old design
wearing the new colours", because only the rules that went through a *token* moved. The
eleven pre-redesign token names survived as an explicitly temporary **legacy bridge** aliasing
onto the new layer, so everything that consumed one moved to the new palette and nothing
broke. Everything that hard-coded a colour instead was untouched: **401 colour literals** sat
below the token block (249 hex, 152 `rgb()`/`rgba()`), **175 of them the retired Tokyo Night
palette** this brief renounces — 59 of the old amber, 39 red, 35 blue, 21 green, 14 cyan, 7
magenta — concentrated in the task board, the audit log, the workflow pane and its mode
chrome, project tabs, session restore, and the attention badge. Until slice B those surfaces
stayed visibly on the old palette while the rest moved, which was a transitional state, not
the design.

Slice B migrated the literals and deleted the bridge; slices C through I restyle the surfaces
to this brief; X9 and X10 need a plan decision before anyone starts them.

## What slice B migrated, and the role map it migrated against

Slice B is the slice that makes the palette visible. It moved all 401 literals onto the
tokens, retired the bridge, and — because rule 3 requires it — wrote down the mapping it used
rather than deciding hue by hue in the diff.

**How a role was chosen.** The token a surface names declares which question its colour is
answering, so the mapping is by role and never by nearest hex. Three questions, in the order
they were asked of every literal:

| If the colour means… | it takes | examples migrated |
| --- | --- | --- |
| something failed, needs you, finished, or is live | `--state-*` | error banners and toasts, the attention chip and its pulse, blocked findings, an awaiting-human task row, a running agent's row edge |
| something the human can act on | `--accent` / `--focus` (a mark, an edge, a ring — never a ground), or `--selection` for the ground under the chosen row (achromatic, #1340) | the active pane's ring, primary buttons, keyboard-selected rows, on-state toggles, the drop indicator, editor search matches |
| *which* thing this is | `--id-*` | git-graph lanes, per-CLI and per-role badges, task-board columns, timeline lanes, workflow node kinds, action families, project-tab and channel colours, diff add/delete, the git status letters |

**One role table, applied everywhere.** The four agent roles were coloured by two surfaces
that disagreed with each other — the session browser painted a reviewer green and an
orchestrator violet, the group roster painted an orchestrator azure and a reviewer violet.
They now share one table: **orchestrator azure, worker jade, reviewer violet, planner amber,
manager orchid** (#1161 added the fifth row, and its rules on every role surface with it),
used by the session badges, the group roster, and the workflow pane's role chips and nodes
alike — and `test/theme.test.ts` reads all four of those surfaces and fails on a role that
disagrees with the table or is missing from a surface that renders every role. A role's colour
is the same thing wherever it appears or it is not identity, it is decoration; that sentence
is a claim, so it is measured rather than asserted.

**Where the eight hues landed.** `lime` and `orchid` had no consumer at all before this
slice: lime now marks a *human* actor in the audit log and the GitHub lane in the timeline
(the two places the app distinguishes "a person did this" from "we did"), and orchid carries
the prototype task column and its `proceed` action — and, since #1161, the MANAGER role,
chosen because the constraint that governs a role hue is distinctness from the other role
hues (a roster shows them side by side) and orchid is the furthest from azure/jade/violet/
amber; rose is the destructive-action dye and lime sits too close to the worker’s jade.
`cyan` is the "ready / start / human testing" family, `violet` everything review- and
PR-shaped.

**Alpha steps are `color-mix`, not new tokens.** The old stylesheet reached a tint by writing
`rgba(224, 175, 104, 0.16)` — the hue restated in a third notation, invisible to every pin.
The migrated form is `color-mix(in srgb, var(--state-attention) 16%, transparent)`, which is
an *expression over a pinned colour*: change the dye in `theme.ts` and every tint of it moves.
The alternative — minting `--state-attention-16` and friends — would have put roughly forty
new colour declarations in `:root`, which is the fourth-copy failure the token layer exists to
prevent. `color-mix` is Baseline-2023 and this app ships against evergreen WebView2, so the
support argument is the same one `:has()` and custom properties already rest on.

**The `Lit` steps stay out of the stylesheet.** A chip whose text was a lightened hue
(`#f2c66a` on an amber chip) now takes the base dye instead. Every hue clears AA on all three
grounds, so the base is measurably legible where the lightened value was only assumed to be,
and `:root` carries what the stylesheet uses rather than the whole palette. The first slice
that genuinely needs a `Lit` step mints and pins it then.

**Two state tokens are still unconsumed, and that is correct.** `--state-held` and
`--state-idle` are achromatic *by design* — a stopped agent is marked by form, not hue — and
the form that marks it is the warp thread, which does not exist until slices C and D. Nothing
in the current chrome is the right home for them, and painting a chip grey to use up a token
would be the opposite of the argument. The delivery-held badge deliberately keeps the
attention dye it has always had (see its own comment in the stylesheet); the *thread* is where
`held` becomes visible.

**What changed on screen beyond the swap.** Six things, each a consequence of the design
rather than a preference:

- The glows are gone (`--accent-glow` was the bridge's one literal). Three rules carried one:
  the two hover glows go entirely, the drop indicator's 22px halo goes with them, and the
  active pane keeps an accent **ring** instead, raised from 12% to 55% so it reads without
  the halo.
- Four hover backgrounds that used to be a hand-mixed value lighter than their rest surface
  now step `--surface-1` → `--surface-2`, so the hover lifts one rung of the ladder rather
  than landing on its own rest colour.
- Eighteen hand-rolled alpha-black shadows collapse onto `--shadow-card` and `--shadow-float`,
  which is the rationing §Elevation asks for.
- A follow/live toggle is interaction, not a state, so `.audit-follow.on` and
  `.timeline-follow.on` take the accent instead of the old green.
- Text and marks sitting **on** a filled hue take `--surface-0`. The eight hues are chosen to
  be legible *as ink* on the dark grounds, so light-on-hue is the pairing that loses
  contrast: the mic button, the voice overlay badge with its dot and spinner, and the
  merged-PR chip move off white onto the dark ink every other filled chip already used.
- The planner's session badge is coloured **at all**. `sessions.ts` emits a role chip for
  every `OrchRole` and the stylesheet had rules for three of the four, so a planner session
  rendered uncoloured — the one role whose colour was not the same wherever it appeared, on
  the surface the role table names first.

**The rule is now measured, not written down.** `test/theme.test.ts` fails on any hex, any
CSS colour function, or any named colour below the token block; on a hue buried inside a
composite token value, where the theme.ts pin cannot see it (a shadow may embed alpha-black
and nothing else); on any surviving value from the retired palette anywhere in `src/`; and on
any reference to a deleted bridge name. Rule 1 was prose while 401 literals contradicted it;
it is a test now.

**Three of those tests measure the ROLE rather than the value, which is the harder half.**
A migration that puts the right pigment in the wrong channel looks perfect and reads wrong,
and no contrast or distinctness check can see it:

- *One role table.* All four surfaces that name an agent role — session badges, the group
  roster, the workflow pane's nodes and its chips — are read and compared against the table
  written above, and the role list itself comes from the `OrchRole` union so a fifth role
  cannot be added and silently skipped. A role missing from a surface that renders every
  role fails too: that is how a planner badge went uncoloured for as long as it did.
- *No position mixes channels.* A rule and its variants (`.x` and `.x.warn`) paint the same
  element in the same property, so they are one position; if one answers "what is this
  doing" and another "which thing is this", the position has two channels and one of them
  is wrong. This is `styles.css`'s own "no `--id-*` in a state position" rule, computed.
- *An overlay over live content stays translucent.* The drop indicator is a wash you read
  the terminal *through*; painted opaque it stops being a preview and becomes an occluder.
  The hue was never wrong there, which is precisely why nothing else would have caught it.
