//! Composed-screen reconstruction for `get_output` (#520).
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! `get_output` used to hand the orchestrator `strip_ansi(raw_ring)` — the raw
//! write stream with escape sequences deleted — and then collapse *consecutive
//! identical* lines (`orchestration::collapse_repeated_frames`). That works
//! for a CLI whose animation redraws a whole line per tick. It does nothing at
//! all for a modern TUI, and Claude Code v2.1.x is the worst case (#520,
//! observed live):
//!
//! - it repaints **partial lines** by cursor address, so after stripping the
//!   escapes the surviving text of two consecutive frames concatenates into
//!   ever-different strings — no two lines are ever byte-identical and a
//!   line-identity dedup never fires;
//! - the spinner **verb cycles** (`Shenaniganing…` → `Roosting…`) and a token
//!   counter ticks, so even a full-line repaint is never a repeat;
//! - the input box holding the (long) delivered prompt is repainted every
//!   frame, so the prompt text multiplies 5-10x across the capture.
//!
//! Two 30-line calls cost the orchestrator ~24k tokens.
//!
//! ## What this does instead
//!
//! Deleting escape sequences throws away the exact information that makes the
//! stream readable: *where each write landed*. A redraw is only noise because
//! it overwrites something — replay the writes onto a screen and the overwrite
//! happens, exactly as it does in the human's terminal. So this module is a
//! small, dependency-free VT replay: feed it the raw ring, get back the
//! composed grid (scrolled-off history rows + the final on-screen rows). Three
//! hundred spinner frames painted over each other collapse to the one frame
//! that is actually on screen, because that is genuinely all that is there.
//!
//! This is the issue's preferred fix shape, and it is CLI-generic in the
//! strongest sense (CLAUDE.md constraint 8): it knows nothing about spinners,
//! verbs, or any CLI's vocabulary — only about ECMA-48. A CLI loomux has never
//! seen gets the same treatment.
//!
//! ## Deliberate limits
//!
//! - **Not a terminal emulator.** Colour, character sets, wide-char widths,
//!   and mouse/bracketed-paste modes are parsed only far enough to be skipped;
//!   we render text placement, not appearance. The one exception is two SGR
//!   attributes — faint and inverse — recorded per cell and read ONLY through
//!   [`render_visible_styled`] (#3426): a CLI's placeholder text in an empty
//!   input box is painted faint, and on text alone it is indistinguishable
//!   from a line a human typed. [`render_screen`] and [`render_visible`] are
//!   byte-for-byte what they were; the attributes never change which character
//!   lands in which cell. A double-width CJK glyph
//!   occupies one cell here and two in the real pane, which can shift a row's
//!   trailing text — cosmetic in a monitoring read.
//! - **Starts blind.** The ring is a 256 KB *tail*, so replay begins mid-stream
//!   against a blank grid with the cursor home. Absolute-addressed paints land
//!   correctly; a relative move off the top edge clamps instead of reaching
//!   content that scrolled out of the ring long ago.
//! - **`get_output` reads [`render_screen`]; the question guard reads
//!   [`render_visible`].** `orchestration::strip_ansi` is unchanged and still
//!   serves every other caller (`box_holds_paste`, the compact/menu
//!   detectors). #530 changed only what the orchestrator *reads*; #534 is the
//!   first place a composed screen also informs what loomux *decides*, and it
//!   does so through [`render_visible`] — see that function's doc for why the
//!   two must not be confused.
