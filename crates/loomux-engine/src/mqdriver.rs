//! The bisecting merge queue — **the driver's write primitives** (#581 slice D1).
//!
//! Design note: `docs/design/merge-queue.md`. Section references below (§4, §5,
//! §6, §7, §8, §10, §11) point into it; that note is the spec this file
//! implements and the argument for every choice made here.
//!
//! # Where the seam is, and why there is one at all
//!
//! `mergeq.rs` (slice C) is the queue's **pure core**: it decides which entries
//! go into a batch, which half a bisect tests next, and whether the merge gate
//! still holds — all as functions over values, with no I/O anywhere. This module
//! is the other half: it is the only place in the queue that talks to `git` and
//! `gh`, and every one of those calls goes through the [`MqRunner`] trait.
//!
//! That trait is the test seam, and it is a **trait parameter** rather than the
//! thread-local override `sessions.rs` uses, because the thing under test here
//! is the **argument vector**, not a directory: a `&dyn MqRunner` a test
//! supplies can record every argv it is handed and hand back canned output, so
//! `tests/mergequeue.rs` pins the exact bytes that would reach the real binaries
//! without a network, a remote, or a real `gh` (CLAUDE.md constraint 3). §8's
//! own sketch (`build_scratch(…, git: &impl GitRunner)`) asks for this shape.
//!
//! **Argv-level assertions are not a stylistic preference here.** §4 spells out
//! why for the scratch push in particular: *every* way of getting create-only
//! wrong degrades to a **silently successful ordinary push**, so an outcome-only
//! test ("did the ref end up at the right SHA?") passes in exactly the cases the
//! check exists to prevent. The same posture covers the landing refspec (§7.5).
//!
//! # What lives here (slice D1) and what is deliberately still missing
//!
//! Here: the [`MqRunner`] seam and its real process implementation; the **live**
//! default-branch and PR lookups §7 requires; the [`validate_target`] refusal
//! core those three enforcement points share; scratch-ref minting with §4's
//! remote collision check; the **create-only** scratch push; the **landing**
//! function, which re-resolves at the moment of submit and is the only thing
//! that ever builds a landing refspec; the [`BatchVerification`] adapter over
//! `notify.rs`'s classification (§5); and namespace-exact cleanup (§10).
//!
//! Not here, and in [`crate::mqloop`] (D2) instead: §8's
//! batch construction (the merge
//! commits onto the scratch), the draft PR and its body builder, the bounded
//! observation loop (`checks_timeout_minutes`), §9's bisect and culprit
//! attribution, §4's crash reconcile, and `merge_queue.json` persistence — plus,
//! since #698 (D3), the **driver tick** that sequences all of it from the
//! unified `gh` poll loop. Everything in this module is reached from a running
//! loomux through that tick; §13 of the design note is the path.
//!
//! # The two properties this module exists to hold
//!
//! 1. **The queue is structurally incapable of targeting the default branch**
//!    (§7). Every branch name that reaches a refspec has come out of
//!    [`validate_target`], which is fed **live** lookups — never
//!    `git::default_base_ref`, never a stored `Task.pr_base`, never a caller's
//!    string. See [`validate_target`]'s own comment for why the local helper is
//!    the wrong authority.
//! 2. **The backend writes only what it can name.** The scratch push is
//!    create-only by *primitive*; the landing push is fast-forward by *verb*;
//!    cleanup deletes only the exact ref this batch minted. No pattern, no
//!    glob, no `--force`.
//!
//! # Why it is in this crate (#888 slice A3 batch 12a)
//!
//! Nothing here is desktop-specific: `std::process` plus [`crate::subproc`]'s
//! bounded capture, and every outbound edge — [`crate::mergeq`],
//! [`crate::notify`], [`crate::workflow`] — was already on this side. The queue
//! runs on the same single `gh` poll loop a headless daemon would run, so the
//! driver belongs with the core it drives rather than with the window.
//!
//! **Three items are `pub(crate)`, and that is the whole of their reach**:
//! `as_args`, `landable` and `declares_ci_green`. They were `pub(super)`
//! in `src-tauri/src/orchestration/mqdriver.rs` — visible within
//! `orchestration` — and batch 12a had to widen them to `pub` for exactly one
//! reason: their only caller, `mqloop`, was still on the other side of the
//! crate boundary, and no visibility narrower than `pub` crosses one. Batch 12b
//! moved `mqloop` here, so that reason expired and the keyword went back down.
//! `pub(crate)` is the faithful translation of the old `pub(super)`, not a new
//! narrowing invented for this batch: the scope that used to be "the
//! `orchestration` module" is now "this crate".
//!
//! It is also load-bearing, which is why it was worth reverting rather than
//! leaving as harmless surplus. `landable` is **half** of the constraint-7
//! refusal — the refspec-shape predicate — and [`validate_target`] is the whole
//! of it, ordering the unverifiable / default-branch / target / assertion
//! refusals so an unreadable answer can never *fail to match* the default and
//! read as safe. While the item was `pub`, "reach the half instead" was
//! reachable from anywhere in `src-tauri` (which depends on this crate directly
//! and already spells `loomux_engine::…` in `gh.rs` and `obs.rs`), and no
//! re-export shape could have prevented it — batch 12a's header said so
//! explicitly and could do nothing about it. Now the compiler prevents it. If
//! you are writing a new branch-name guard: [`validate_target`], and from
//! inside this crate you have no other option.
