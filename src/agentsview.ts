// The Agents tab (#2122 slice B): one row per pane in the window, saying what
// each agent is doing right now, with a click to go there.
//
// WHAT IT COSTS. Nothing on the wire. Every row is derived from
// `Pane.facts()` — a projection of state the pane already holds, which reads no
// geometry, starts no IPC and touches no timer (slice A's contract, the same one
// `tabPaneInfo()` carries) — so a refresh is a walk over open panes and a diff
// against the rows already on screen. The only clock is the 1 s ticker below,
// which exists because two of the inputs (the output burst, the roster reading)
// change without an event, and it is armed ONLY while this tab is the one being
// looked at, gated on window visibility on top of that.
//
// THE DIFF IS THE POINT. Rows are keyed by `PaneFacts.key` and updated in
// place: a re-render that replaced the list would restart the working spinner's
// CSS animation on every tick, which is the per-frame churn the issue rules out
// in as many words. Only a pane appearing, disappearing or moving in the sort
// order touches the list's child order.
