// The delivery-queue depth badge (#814), driven end to end through the real
// event path — this is the coverage that stands in for the human DOM look the
// PR originally asked for, so it deliberately asserts the things an eyeball
// would have caught and a unit test cannot:
//
//   1. the chip actually renders, with the count/cap/age in its own label
//      (#813's lesson: a detail only a hover reveals is a detail nobody sees);
//   2. a stalled queue is visibly different — asserted as a real computed-style
//      difference, so a stylesheet that never applied fails here rather than
//      looking fine to a selector;
//   3. a minimized pane keeps its count on the dock chip (delegate panes open
//      minimized, so this is where agent queues are actually seen);
//   4. on a narrow pane wearing several chips the badge yields its own room
//      first — it may cost the header no more than the box `flex-shrink`
//      cannot touch, and may not take width from the pane's drag handle — and
//      — constraint 1 — the terminal's geometry does not move.
//
// **How it drives the badge, and what that does and does not prove.** The spec
// emits `orch-queue-depth` from the page through `plugin:event|emit`, which is
// exactly what the bundled `emit()` compiles to (see @tauri-apps/api's
// `event.js`/`core.js`) — so the event round-trips through the backend's real
// broadcaster and arrives at the app's real `listen()` handler. What is
// exercised is therefore the whole frontend half: handler → `readingsByPty` →
// `setQueueDepth` → DOM/CSS → dock mirror. What is NOT exercised is the Rust
// producer that decides *when* to emit; that half is pinned by the eight
// backend tests in `src-tauri/tests/orchestration/` (queue depth, the
// oldest-entry clock, the stall threshold, the coarsening, and the emit skip
// with its release). Splitting it this way is deliberate: producing a real
// queued delivery would mean spawning a real agent CLI, which this repo
// forbids outright.
//
// Every pane here is a plain shell (`createTerminalPane`), never an agent kind.
