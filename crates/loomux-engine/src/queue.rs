//! Pure core of the per-pane delivery queue (#445): "hold means queued,
//! never doomed." Before this, `deliver_prompt`'s three hold-cap seams
//! (box-occupied, pre-paste question, pre-Enter question) DESTROYED the
//! payload once their bounded wait expired, and told the sender the
//! delivery merely succeeded. That is safe only if the release condition
//! for the hold is expected to clear in seconds; this repo's standing
//! requirement is the opposite — the user is frequently AWAY, an agent asks
//! a question, and they answer minutes or hours later. A timeout measured
//! in seconds is structurally wrong for a release condition of "a human
//! answers."
//!
//! The fix: the hold caps stay exactly as they are (they bound *thread
//! blocking*, which is a legitimate concern — one OS thread per pending
//! delivery, forever, is not free), but the outcome AT the cap changes from
//! "destroy the payload" to "enqueue it." A per-pane, in-memory FIFO plus a
//! drainer thread (see `OrchRegistry::deliver_now`/`run_queue_drainer` in
//! `mod.rs` for the impure half) replays queued entries, oldest first, the
//! instant the pane becomes deliverable again — no timeout, no sender
//! action required.
//!
//! Everything in this module is a plain function over plain data — no
//! registry, no `gh`. Pre-#470, this module carried one deliberate
//! exception (`queue_is_non_empty`, taking the live queue-map lock
//! directly) because two SEPARATE checkpoints — the front door and
//! `deliver_now`'s pre-paste recheck — both had to consult the identical
//! live state or drift to different definitions of "this pane is already
//! spoken for." #470 removes the exception by removing the SECOND
//! checkpoint's reason to exist: every delivery is now admitted into the
//! queue at arrival, in `mod.rs`'s `enqueue_text` (impure, as admission
//! necessarily is — it mutates the live queue), and nothing downstream ever
//! needs to re-ask "is someone else already ahead of me," because the
//! queue's own front/back discipline makes that structurally impossible to
//! answer wrong. See `notify.rs`'s module doc for why this codebase
//! otherwise splits every backend feature this way (pure policy here,
//! impure wiring in `mod.rs`) and `doc/design/orchestration.md`'s "Delivery
//! queue (#445)" section — its "Ordering" subsection covers #470's redesign
//! specifically, and its "Durability (#468/#467)" subsection the on-disk
//! snapshot below — for the full design rationale.
//!
//! **Durability across a restart (#468/#467).** The queue is no longer
//! in-memory only. Every mutation of a pane's queue rewrites that group's
//! `queue.json` through `atomic_write` (the #133 precedent: temp file,
//! fsync, rename — a disk-full or a crash mid-write leaves the previous
//! good snapshot, never a truncated file), and a restart reads it back:
//! `parse_snapshot` → `split_recovered` here, `OrchRegistry::
//! recover_persisted_queue`/`readmit_recovered` in `mod.rs`. What that buys,
//! stated exactly, because the honest limits are the point (see this
//! module's `PersistedEntry` doc and `doc/design/orchestration.md`'s
//! "Durability (#468/#467)" subsection):
//!
//! - A queued `Text` payload survives the restart with its bytes intact.
//! - It is **re-admitted automatically** — same queue, same order — when the
//!   pane it was addressed to comes back with a durable identity loomux can
//!   match: the group's single orchestrator, or an agent resumed onto the
//!   same CLI session id. Neither `pty_id` nor `agent_id` is that identity:
//!   `pty_id` is re-minted at restore, and `agent_id` — durable since #524,
//!   so it never names a *different* agent — still names no LIVE pane after
//!   one, because a restore spawns a new agent with a new id.
//! - Anything else (a worker pane simply gone after the restart) is
//!   **surfaced, never silently dropped**: `queue_orphans` reports it with
//!   its payload so the orchestrator's session-start re-sync can re-derive
//!   and re-send it. `orphaned_queue_entries` below still derives the same
//!   view from `audit.jsonl` alone, which is what covers entries queued by a
//!   build older than this one (no snapshot on disk to read).
//! - A `StrandedSubmit` marker is deliberately NOT replayable: it means
//!   "text is already sitting in that pane's input box, press Enter." After
//!   a restart the box is gone, so pressing Enter would submit whatever the
//!   new session happens to have there. Recovery drops markers, audits each
//!   one, and surfaces them — see `split_recovered`.

///   are read side by side, and a reason that reads differently in the two is
///   a reason a human cannot grep for — see [`STRANDED_ORPHAN_REASON`] for
///   what that costs).
/// - **OLD build, NEW snapshot** — the old build has no such variant, so
///   `parse_snapshot`'s per-entry tolerance skips exactly that entry and
///   counts it in `skipped` (audited by the caller), leaving every sibling
///   entry intact. That is the same downgrade shape [`QueuedDelivery`]'s

/// #445 rev-35 B1 — the ordering PROPERTY, exhaustively, not one scenario.
///
/// **Superseded by #470 — kept as a historical record, not deleted.** This
/// module models the algorithm `deliver_now`'s pre-paste recheck implemented:
/// a raw per-pty mutex race for a fresh delivery, PLUS a live recheck right
/// before pasting to defer to a queue that formed underneath it. Proven
/// correct here for exactly 2 simultaneous contenders; the 3-contender
/// residual this module ALSO proves (below) is exactly the defect #470's
/// unified-admission redesign closes — see `unified_admission_property`
/// (this file) for the model of what replaced this mechanism, and
/// `doc/design/orchestration.md`'s Ordering subsection for the argument.
/// Every test in this module still passes unmodified: they are pure math
/// about an algorithm this PR stops running in production, not a live
/// regression pin — keeping them intact is what lets `unified_admission_
/// property`'s own mutation test point back at a REAL example of the
/// class of bug being closed, instead of asserting it in the abstract.
///
/// The review's finding: `deliver_now` never re-checked the queue after its
/// own hold, so a delivery already in flight (holding the pane's delivery
/// mutex through a pre-paste hold) when another delivery timed out and
/// queued could still paste directly once ITS OWN hold cleared — "now go"
/// landing before "here's the context." The fix is the pre-paste recheck in
/// `deliver_now` (mod.rs): immediately before pasting, re-consult
/// `queue_is_non_empty` and defer to the queue if it now says yes.
///
/// `deliver_now`'s live pipeline cannot run in this test suite (no real
/// pty/`AppHandle` — see the module doc's "Scope" section and every other
/// `deliver_now`-adjacent doc comment for the same boundary), so this
/// cannot execute real threads racing a real mutex. What it CAN do, and
/// what a single hand-picked scenario test cannot: model the algorithm's
/// actual decision rule (front door defers iff the queue is non-empty at
/// arrival; the in-flight recheck defers iff the queue is non-empty
/// immediately before paste) and exhaustively search every reachable
/// interleaving of {a fresh delivery arriving, the current mutex holder's
/// hold resolving — by timing out OR by clearing, both explored — and
/// rechecking, the drainer popping the queue's front}, checking rev-35's
/// own wording for the property on every terminal state: **a delivery that
/// arrived later never lands before an earlier [arrived] delivery.**
///
/// **Scope: exactly 2 contending deliveries, not 3+ — argued, not assumed.**
/// With exactly two deliveries to one pane, the per-pty delivery mutex has
/// AT MOST one waiter at any moment: whichever arrives second is
/// unambiguously "next" once the first releases the mutex, so arrival order
/// and mutex-acquisition order coincide by construction — this is precisely
/// rev-35's own 2-delivery scenario, generalized over every interleaving of
/// arrival/hold/release for those two. With THREE OR MORE simultaneously
/// contending, `std::sync::Mutex` grants to waiters in an unspecified
/// order — if X and Y both arrive while a third delivery holds the mutex
/// and the queue is still empty, whichever of X/Y the scheduler happens to
/// grant the mutex to next runs its own hold-and-decide cycle first,
/// independent of which of them arrived first. That is a DIFFERENT defect
/// (mutex-acquisition fairness among simultaneous waiters, not a missing
/// queue recheck) that a localized "recheck before paste" cannot fix — see
/// `pre_470_algorithm_three_way_contention_inverted_arrival_order`,
/// below (renamed by #470 review B3 — see that test's own doc), which
/// documents it rather than silently dropping it. Restricting
/// THIS property's exhaustive search to 2 is what keeps it non-vacuous: an
/// earlier draft ran it at 3 and found violations in the FIXED run too —
/// not because the fix was wrong, but because the property as phrased
/// (raw arrival order, no scoping) is provably unachievable by any
/// localized fix once 3+ contenders are possible.
///
/// **Deliberately MORE adversarial than the real system, not less** (within
/// its 2-delivery scope). In production the drainer's own paste attempt
/// shares the SAME per-pty delivery mutex as a direct delivery
/// (`deliver_now`'s `lock` parameter), so a drain pop is actually
/// serialized behind whatever currently holds it. This model does NOT
/// impose that extra constraint — a `Drain` event is available any time the
/// queue is non-empty, mutex state notwithstanding. That only WIDENS the
/// set of interleavings explored beyond what the real mutex would ever
/// allow; the real system's reachable states are a subset of this model's.
/// A property proven here therefore holds a fortiori in production — this
/// is an over-approximation of danger, not an under-approximation of it.
///
/// **Mutation-verified** (rev-35's ask): `defer_check_upheld_for_two_
/// contenders` runs the search with the actual fix's decision rule and must
/// find zero violations; `defer_check_disabled_finds_a_real_inversion` runs
/// the IDENTICAL search with the recheck neutralized (always "paste, never
/// defer" — base-branch behavior) and must find at least one. If the
/// second test ever started passing (zero violations even with the recheck
/// disabled), the first test would be proven vacuous — passing regardless
/// of whether the fix does anything — so it is exactly as load-bearing as
/// the property test itself.

/// longer has two separate admission paths (race a raw mutex when the queue
/// looks empty; append directly when it doesn't) — EVERY delivery pushes to
/// the BACK of the SAME queue, atomically with the check for whether the
/// queue was empty (`enqueue_text`'s `was_first`). Whichever push observes
/// an empty queue is the one that starts processing; every other push, no
/// matter how it got here, is already correctly positioned behind whatever
/// arrived first.
///
/// **Why this closes what a fair mutex alone does not (NB-A).** A reviewer
/// of the original #470 filing proved that simply making the OLD per-pty
/// mutex fair is insufficient: `b1_ordering_property`'s recheck-and-
/// defer-to-TAIL mechanism loses a delivery's arrival position whenever a
/// LATER arrival used the old front door's "queue already non-empty ->
/// append directly" bypass — a path that never touched the mutex, fair or
/// not, at all. This model has no such bypass to lose position to: there is
/// exactly one admission function, and it is the SAME push whether the
/// queue is empty or not. A delivery's position in `queue` is fixed the
/// instant it's admitted and never changes until it's delivered — there is
/// no "defer to tail" step left to model, because nothing can ever cut in
/// front of an already-admitted entry.
///
/// **Why a hold-cap TIMEOUT needs no event of its own (unlike
/// `b1_ordering_property`'s `HoldTimesOut`/`HoldClears` split).** Pre-#470,
/// a timeout had to perform a state transition (enqueue the holder, THEN
/// release the mutex to a waiter) because the timed-out delivery had no
/// queue representation until that moment. Post-#470 it already has one —
/// it's sitting at the front of `queue` from the moment it arrived — so a
/// timeout changes nothing observable: the entry stays exactly where it
/// is and the same thread simply tries again later. The only state-changing
/// resolution left is delivering: popping the front and recording it, which
/// this model represents as a single `processing`-gated event enabled
/// whenever something is currently being attempted.
///
/// **The mutation knob.** `deliver_from_back` is this model's ONE toggle,
/// in the same spirit as `b1_ordering_property`'s `defer_check`: `false` is
/// the real #470 algorithm (always resolve the FRONT — genuine FIFO);
/// `true` breaks the one line that makes admission order equal delivery
/// order, popping the BACK instead, to prove the exhaustive search actually
/// notices an inversion rather than passing vacuously. See

/// #496 PR-C (rev-47 B1) — the stranded self-heal's ADMISSION, exhaustively.
///
/// The heal pushes a `StrandedSubmit` marker to the FRONT of a pane's queue,
/// which is the one place in this design where anything other than the
/// drainer touches the front. That is safe only while no drainer OWNS the
/// front entry: a drainer inside `deliver_now` has already peeked its entry
/// and finishes with `pop_front_dequeued(that id)`, which pops ONLY on an id
/// match. A marker slipped in front makes that pop match nothing, leaving an
/// ALREADY-DELIVERED entry queued for a second, duplicate delivery — the
/// exact hazard class #470 B1's own model exists for, one layer up.
///
/// The first shipped gate checked `queue_draining` and pushed in SEPARATE
/// lock scopes, so a drainer registering in the gap re-opened the hazard
/// (review rev-47 B1). The fix fuses the check and the push into one
/// critical section on `queues`, reading `queue_draining` while holding it.
/// This model is the proof, and — like every property module in this file —
/// carries its own mutation control so it cannot pass vacuously.
///
/// **The mutation knob.** `fused` is the ONE toggle: `true` is the real
/// (post-fix) algorithm, where "observe whether a drainer is registered" and
/// "push the marker" are a single indivisible step; `false` is the
/// shipped-then-fixed shape, where the observation is taken, other threads
/// may run, and the push happens later against a stale observation. See
/// `unfused_admission_reproduces_the_duplicate_delivery` below.
///
/// **What is modeled**, one event each, in every order the search can reach:
/// a delivery arriving (push to BACK — the front door's only move), its
/// drainer registering, that drainer peeking the front (taking ownership),
/// that drainer finishing (popping ONLY on an id match, exactly as
/// `pop_front_dequeued` does), and the heal's gate/push. Timeouts and
/// retries are omitted for the same reason the module above omits them: they
/// are self-loops this property cannot observe.

/// #454 — supersession vs. a newer delivery's IN-FLIGHT window, exhaustively.
///
/// #451 B1 gave the late-confirmation monitor a supersession rule: if this
/// pane's recorded `DeliveryOutcome` no longer carries this monitor's own
/// `submit_sent_ms`, a newer delivery owns the pane and the monitor exits
/// writing and notifying nothing. That rule is right; its TRIGGER was late.
/// The ledger was written only when the newer delivery's confirm window
/// resolved — under a second when its hook confirms in-window, ~9s worst
/// case — while the `promptsubmit` record that delivery's Enter produces
/// exists almost immediately. In between, a stale monitor reads "still mine"
/// from the ledger and matches the NEWER delivery's record as its own: a
/// misattributed `delivery-confirmed-late` audit row, and — if that monitor
/// had already declared `Failed` — a "no re-send needed" correction about the
/// very re-send that is the only reason anything landed. On a Copilot pane it
/// does not even need the two deliveries to share text: `PromptLandedMatch::
/// Existence` matches any record past the monitor's baseline, whatever it
/// says.
///
/// The fix is an ORDERING, and this model is its proof. Two knobs, each the
/// pre-#454 shape of one half, so neither half can pass vacuously:
///
/// - `publish_before_enter` — `deliver_now` calls `record_inflight_delivery`
///   immediately BEFORE its first Enter (`true`), rather than claiming the
///   ledger only at its outcome insert (`false`, as shipped).
/// - `ledger_read_after_hook` — the monitor takes its ledger observation
///   AFTER its hook read (`true`, via `observe_ledger`), rather than before
///   it (`false`, as shipped).
///
/// Both together give a happens-before chain — ledger claim, then Enter, then
/// the hook record, then any tick that can see that record, then that tick's
/// own ledger read — so a record a tick can act on is always checked against
/// a ledger state at least as new as the record itself. Either knob alone
/// leaves a window: with only the reader fix the ledger claim still lands
/// seconds late; with only the writer fix the gap shrinks to one tick's own
/// work but a violation is still reachable. `run` explores every interleaving
/// of both, and the tests below pin exactly that — fixed is clean, each
/// single-knob mutation reddens, and the as-shipped shape (both off) reddens.
///
/// **What is modeled**, one event each, in every order the search can reach:
/// the newer delivery's program in strict order (claim the ledger — only when
/// `publish_before_enter` — press Enter, record its outcome), a genuinely
/// LATE `promptsubmit` record for the OLD delivery arriving on its own (the
/// case the monitor exists to catch, so the property cannot be satisfied by
/// simply never confirming anything), and the old monitor's tick — its two
/// reads, individually interleavable, then its decision, following
/// `late_monitor_tick`'s real precedence (superseded beats even a hook
/// match). Timeouts, retries and the pane-quiet/question inputs are omitted
/// for the same reason the sibling modules omit theirs: they are self-loops
/// this property cannot observe.
///
/// **Deliberately more adversarial than production.** Nothing here forces the
/// monitor's two reads to be close together, or the newer delivery's steps to
/// be quick — the search happily runs a whole monitor tick between the newer
/// delivery's Enter and its next step. Production's reachable states are a
/// subset of this model's, so a property proven here holds a fortiori.
