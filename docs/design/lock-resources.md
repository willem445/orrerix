# Design: named lock resources (#858)

Status: implemented (PR #859). Config in `orchestration::workflow`, engine in
`orchestration::locks`, wiring and lifecycle in `orchestration::mod`, tools in
`orchestration::mcp`, chrome in `src/locklines.ts` + `src/groupview.ts`.

## Problem

Several agents in one group share one machine. Some of what they reach for is singular:
a compile that saturates every core, a GPU, a device on a port, a fixed port number, a
staging database. Nothing in loomux ever told them to take turns, so four workers started
four builds and the machine fell over.

The immediate motivation was concrete: during an Actions-budget pause, local compile/test
work had to be serialized, and it was done with a **hand-rolled `mkdir` lock written into
worker briefs**. That worked, and it was not a mechanism — it was prose, per brief,
unaudited, with no reclaim if the holder died. This issue makes it first-class.

## What this is NOT: the enforcement design, and why it was abandoned

#318 asked the same question and got a different answer: shadow the guarded program on
`PATH` (the `gh`/`git` shim pattern), count slots in a semaphore directory, and make
`cargo build` itself wait. #322 implemented it and was **closed unmerged** after live
testing (#335): the shim only intercepts invocations that go through the shell it shadows.
A PowerShell or absolute-path invocation walked straight past the `.cmd` delegator, so the
guarantee the design appeared to give was not one it could keep. Covering every invocation
shape reliably is a much larger surface than the problem justifies.

So this design does not attempt enforcement at all, and says so in every place an agent or
a human reads about it. **An agent holds a lock because it asked for one.** What loomux
supplies instead is the part a hand-rolled lock cannot: a declared vocabulary, a fair queue,
bounded holds, automatic reclaim, and an audit trail of who held what for how long.

The honest framing matters more than it looks. An advisory lock that is *described* as
advisory is a tool a human can reason about ("w-3 has held `build` for 40 minutes — is it
stuck?"). An advisory lock described as enforcement is a claim the code does not back, which
this repo treats as a defect in its own right.

## Config: `resources:` in `.loomux/workflow.yml`

```yaml
resources:
  build: { slots: 1, max_hold_minutes: 45 }
  gpu:   { slots: 2 }
```

Two numbers, keyed by a name the repo chooses. That is the whole schema, and it is the whole
of CLAUDE.md constraint 8's requirement: **loomux never learns what `build` means.** There is
no `program:`, no `command:`, no `match:` — nothing that would make the product code know
about a toolchain. Compare #322's design, which had to carry `program`/`args` matchers
precisely *because* it was trying to intercept commands; dropping enforcement drops the
toolchain knowledge with it. That is a second, unplanned argument for the cooperative shape.

**Restrict-only.** `workflow.yml` is untrusted repo input (whoever opens a PR authors it), so
every clause is measured against the capability-closure spine in `workflow.rs`'s module doc.
`resources:` can only ever make an agent *wait*. It names no branch, no reviewer, no program
and no agent; nothing in the merge or release path reads it; and `deny_unknown_fields` on
`RawResource` makes a gate-shaped key a hard parse error rather than an ignored line. The
`RawWorkflow` field-inventory test in `workflow.rs` forces a human to make that argument
again for any field added here. The residual abuse is a hostile PR declaring `slots: 1` on
something everyone needs, to slow the group down — bounded by `max_hold_minutes`, visible in
the panel, and audited throughout.

**Every bad value is a hard error, never a substitution.** `slots: 0`, `slots: 65`,
`max_hold_minutes: 0`, `max_hold_minutes: 481`, a name outside the identifier alphabet, more
than `RESOURCES_MAX` resources — all fail the parse of the whole file. This is
`merge_queue.max_batch`'s posture, for its reason: a repo that wrote `slots: 0` believes its
builds are serialized, and silently substituting the default would leave that belief in place
while the behaviour changed underneath it. Names are *rejected*, never rewritten, for the
`blocks[].id` reason: an author who wrote `heavy build` must not end up with a resource called
`heavybuild` that the `acquire_lock` call in their own worker brief cannot name.

**Gated on the advanced orchestrator**, like every other clause in this file: with the toggle
off, `workflow.yml` is not the group's config and is never opened. One reader
(`OrchRegistry::lock_resources`) for the whole block, the rule `merge_queue_policy` states —
a tool and a background sweep that disagreed about the declared set would grant and reclaim
on different worlds.

**Empty means off, all the way up to the tool listing.** `mcp::tool_defs` takes the declared
menu and omits all three tools when it is empty, so a repo that declares nothing pays neither
the behaviour nor the context. The declared names are folded *into* the `acquire_lock`
description, because an agent that cannot see what exists guesses (`cargo`, `build-lock`,
`ci`) and collects refusals instead of a lock.

## The load-bearing decision: acquire never blocks

`acquire_lock` returns immediately — granted, or queued with a position — and a grant that
arrives later is **typed into the caller's pane** as an `[orrerix]` notice, exactly like a
`notify_when` watch resolving.

The alternative (block the MCP call until the lock is free) is a deadlock by construction, and
loomux has already paid for that lesson once. An `[orrerix]` notice is delivered by *writing into
a pane*, and a pane that is mid-call cannot take a delivery — so an agent blocked waiting for
its lock would be blocking the delivery of the message telling it the lock is ready. That is
#590's shape reached by a new route, and it would be worse than #590 because nothing external
resolves it: the queue only moves when loomux writes to the pane.

This is why the queued reply is worded the way it is. It states the position, and then it says
**END YOUR TURN** and explains what will wake the agent — because a worker told only "queued"
reliably invents a sleep loop, and the sleep loop is the deadlock.

## Semantics, and the reasoning behind each

- **Slots.** `holders.len() < slots` admits; otherwise the request joins the queue. `slots: 1`
  is a mutex; anything more is a counting semaphore.
- **FIFO.** `VecDeque`, push back, pop front. #322's `flock`-poll design could not offer this
  and documented starvation as a known caveat bounded by a timeout; a cooperative queue held in
  one process gets fairness for free, so it takes it.
- **Idempotent re-acquire, with no refresh.** Asking again while holding reports the existing
  hold and its **original** deadline; asking again while queued reports the **original**
  position. Both matter after a `/compact`, when an agent cannot remember whether its own call
  landed — "just ask again" has to be safe. The no-refresh half is the important one: a hold
  whose deadline moved every time its holder said "still mine" would be an unbounded hold with
  extra steps, and `max_hold_minutes` would bound nothing.
- **Release of a lock you do not hold is an error** — you believe you are serialized and you
  are not, which is worth being told. **Release while queued withdraws the request** and says
  so. That third state is deliberate: without it a worker that no longer needs the resource
  cannot leave the queue except by timing out, and would then be *granted* a slot it never uses
  and sit on it for a full `max_hold_minutes` while everyone behind it waits.
- **Live config reload.** Every entry point reconciles the table against the file
  (`LockTable::sync`): a new resource appears, an undeclared one is removed (and what it took
  with it is audited — dropping live holders silently would be the claim-the-code-doesn't-back
  defect), and `slots`/`max_hold_minutes` retune in place. A **shrunk `slots` never revokes a
  live hold**; it stops new grants until the count falls back under the new limit. That is the
  only reading that cannot yank a resource out from under a build already running, and existing
  holds keep the deadline they were granted under for the same reason.

## Every wait and every hold is bounded

The lessons-file rule — a suppression driven by a fallible signal must be bounded — applies
twice here, because "the holder will call `release_lock`" and "the waiter still wants this"
are both fallible.

| bound | ends how | who is told |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `max_hold_minutes` | sweep reclaims the hold (`lock-expired`) | the ex-holder, in its pane: your work is no longer serialized |
| `wait_minutes` (5–240, default 60) | sweep drops the request (`lock-wait-timeout`) | the waiter, in its pane |
| holder's pane dies | `mark_dead` reclaims immediately (`lock-reclaim`) | nobody — there is no pane; the next in line is told it has the lock |
| waiter's pane dies | `mark_dead` drops it (`lock-wait-cleanup`) | nobody |

`wait_minutes` is clamped by `notify::clamp_expires_minutes` — the same function, not a second
copy of the same bounds, because it is the same quantity: a bounded wait on something external.

**Two reclaim paths on purpose.** `mark_dead` is the fast path (every kill, crash, idle-reap and
planner auto-close funnels through it, beside `cleanup_agent_watches`), so a finished worker's
slot is free instantly rather than up to 30s later. The sweep is the backstop for a holder that
somehow leaves without that path running, and it is the *only* path for the two clock-driven
cases. Neither alone is sufficient: the fast path cannot see an overrun, and the sweep alone
would make every hand-off wait for a tick.

**The sweep lives in `gh_poll_tick`**, beside `notify_tick`, rather than owning a thread: same
30s cadence, same paused-group freeze, and no I/O of its own beyond the audit lines it writes.
It takes `now` as a parameter, which is what makes expiry testable without waiting 45 minutes.

**A pause freezes the clocks, not the human.** `locks_tick` skips a paused group entirely — no
expiry, no wait timeout, no hand-off driven by either — and credits it the pause span on the tick
that observes it unpaused. This is `notify_tick`'s TTL-freeze, applied to locks, and it needs its
own `paused_locks_since` map rather than sharing the watches' one: two tick paths crediting the
same map would charge one pause span twice. A pause is not a reason to take a running build's lock
away.

**It does not freeze `mark_dead`, and that is the right asymmetry** — worth stating because the
first draft of the user docs claimed otherwise (rev-lead, PR #859 finding 2). Killing a pane while
a group is paused still reclaims that agent's holds and still promotes the queue. A timer firing
during a pause is the thing a pause exists to suppress; a human clicking ✕ on a holder is a
deliberate act whose whole point is that the slot comes back. The grant notice then waits in the
new holder's pane queue until the group resumes, exactly like every other delivery to a paused
group — so nothing is lost, it is only deferred.

**The credit is clamped to what each entry actually lived through.** Panes keep running while a
group is paused, so a lock taken *during* the pause never experienced the part of the span that
elapsed before it existed. Unclamped, a hold granted a second before the resume would have its
deadline pushed out by the entire pause — the generous direction, but a deadline nobody could
predict from the config. `extend_deadlines` therefore credits
`min(pause_span, now - acquired_ms)`, which is the same clamp, for the same reason, that rev-orch
put on the watch TTLs in #247 ("B2").

## The agent-authored `note`

`acquire_lock` takes an optional `note` — a label for what the holder is doing, which is what lets
a human tell a 40-minute hold that is progress from one that is a hang. It is the only
agent-authored string in this feature, so it is worth being precise about where it goes: the audit
log, `list_locks` (so **every other agent in the group reads it**, which the tool description now
says), and the panel row plus its hover detail.

It is **whitespace-collapsed and capped at 200 characters in `trim_note`**, at the engine boundary
rather than per-renderer. The collapse is the load-bearing half: the panel's hover detail joins one
line per holder and per waiter with `\n`, so a note that kept its own newlines could forge a queue
entry that does not exist (`"build\n#1 in queue: w-9 — waiting 3h"`). Nothing executable is
involved and every render path is `textContent`/`title`, but a field one agent writes and every
other agent reads should not be able to invent structure in the surface that displays it. Doing it
once at the boundary fixes the audit log and `list_locks` in the same stroke.

The **resource name** is a separate question and is handled by the parser: `sanitize_id`'s
letters/digits/`-`/`_` alphabet, reject-not-rewrite. That matters more than it looks, because the
name *is* interpolated into the `[orrerix]` notices typed into panes — the alphabet is what stops a
repo-authored name from forging a prompt there. The `note` never reaches a pane-typed notice at
all.

## Persistence: none, deliberately

Lock state is `Mutex<HashMap<group, LockTable>>` on the registry, in memory only — the same
lifetime class as `watches` and `channels`. A lock file surviving a restart could only ever
describe holders that no longer exist, because every pane that could have held a lock died with
the process. So there is nothing to reconcile on startup and no stale-lock-file failure mode,
which is a strictly simpler system than the durable one and loses nothing real.

## Layering

The state machine (`locks.rs`) is a pure function of (state, clock, liveness): `sweep` takes
`now` and an `is_live` closure, and knows nothing about the registry, panes, or the audit log.
That is what lets its contention, FIFO, reclaim and idempotence properties be unit-tested
exhaustively with a fake clock. The registry half is deliberately thin — reconcile, call, audit,
deliver — and is covered by integration tests driving the real `dispatch()`, because the parts
that can silently do nothing (the listing, the role gate, the pane notice, the `mark_dead` hook,
the sweep's place in the tick) all live there rather than in the engine.

No registry mutex is ever held across `audit` or `deliver_prompt`: both block (file I/O, a
per-pane delivery mutex). `with_locks` returns what the reconcile dropped and audits it after
releasing the table, and `locks_tick` snapshots liveness from `agents` *before* taking `locks`,
so those two are only ever acquired in one order.

## Visibility

One payload (`OrchRegistry::lock_state`) serves both `list_locks` and the `orch_lock_state`
Tauri command, so what the human sees beside the panes and what an agent reads can never
disagree. The chrome is a row in the group lifecycle overlay — chrome inside an overlay that
already floats over the terminal, so CLAUDE.md constraint 1 is untouched, and `minChromeHeight()`
measures it rather than being told about it. Formatting lives in the DOM-free `src/locklines.ts`
so it is unit-testable; the tone ladder (neutral → amber when somebody is waiting → red when a
reclaim is imminent) reuses the panel's existing colour vocabulary rather than inventing one.

## Known limits, stated rather than hidden

- **Bypassable by construction.** An agent that never calls `acquire_lock` is not serialized.
  This is the design, not a gap in it — see the enforcement section above.
- **Per group, per process.** Two groups on the same machine contending for the same physical
  resource do not see each other. A machine-wide scope is possible (root the table outside the
  group) and is deliberately not built: nothing has asked for it, and the per-group scope is the
  one the queue's own fairness and audit trail are meaningful in.
- **A granted lock can idle.** An agent granted a lock while mid-turn will not read the notice
  until its turn ends. `max_hold_minutes` bounds that, and it is the same bound that covers a
  holder that simply forgets.
- **A `mode: replace` persona is not told about locks.** The two instruction fragments are
  substituted into the role templates, and a replace-mode block gets `mechanics_core` instead.
  That is the same gap `MERGE_QUEUE_NOTE` has, and it is left alone here deliberately rather
  than widened by one feature: which loomux mechanics survive a persona replacement is a
  question about `mechanics_core`'s contract, not about this one.

## Where the instructions live, and why they are conditional

The three tools are taught in `templates/{orchestrator,worker,reviewer}.md` — but behind
`{{LOCKS_ORCH}}` / `{{LOCKS}}`, substituted only when the group is advanced **and** the repo
declares a non-empty `resources:`. `planner.md` gets nothing, because a planner is refused the
tools — **all three of them, at the dispatch gate**, not merely omitted from the listing.
`list_locks` is read-only, but it returns every holder and waiter in the group, and the
shared-tier read-only tool beside it (`list_notifications`) gates for the same #203 reason. The
refusal names *locks* rather than watches: one gate, two answers (`PlannerDenied`), because #203's
argument has a different consequence for each family and a planner told "you cannot register
notifications" when it asked for a lock learns nothing about why.

That conditionality is not tidiness. `the_default_rendering_never_names_the_gate_machinery`
exists to catch prose naming a mechanism the reader does not have, and it caught this: the
first cut put the bullets in the base templates, where a group with no workflow file at all
would have read about `.loomux/workflow.yml`. Conditional framing inside the prose ("these
exist only if your repo declares…") does not save it — that is an invitation to go looking.
Gated on the *declaration* rather than on the toggle alone for the same reason
`MERGE_QUEUE_NOTE` is gated on the queue being enabled: a repo can run a workflow and declare
no resources, and that group has the workflow's machinery but not this.

Two fragments rather than one because the orchestrator's job with a lock is a different job:
an agent takes and releases one; an orchestrator decides which task needs one and reads the
queue to understand why a worker is quiet. One shared paragraph would have had to say both
things to both readers.
