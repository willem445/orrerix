// The file-MANAGER surface a file-explorer pane hosts (issue #214). The Explorer /
// Finder / Nautilus equivalent: browse folders, and double-click a file to open it
// in **the OS default application for its extension** — loomux never opens it.
//
// This is deliberately NOT `FileEditView` (the `Alt+F` in-app editor). PR #215
// first shipped the editor embedded in the pane; the human's clarification on #214
// is explicit that a native-style manager is what's wanted, and that the editor
// reuse is "explicitly NOT the preferred direction". The editor is untouched and
// still lives behind `Alt+F`; this is a different surface for a different job.
//
// The class owns only DOM wiring. Everything decidable is in the pure modules it
// composes — `fileexplorermodel.ts` (listing order, the rooted-navigation bound,
// formatting, the inline-edit state machine) and `filematch.ts` (the Go-to-file
// ranking) — and all path safety is enforced backend-side in `filemgr.rs`.
