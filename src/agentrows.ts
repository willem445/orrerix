 *  3. the launch line is loomux's own INFERENCE, and it is held to the
 *     LAUNCHER'S OWN CATALOG — `namesLaunchableCli`, below.
 *
 *  ARM 3 IS NOT OPTIONAL AND ARM 2 CANNOT STAND IN FOR IT. `harness` is
 *  `sessionCliFromCommand`, a closed FOUR-name membership test built to match
 *  `listSessions()` rows — it answers `null` for `codex`, `gemini`,
 *  `hermes` and `ante`, which are four of the eight CLIs the launcher can
 *  start a pane on. A predicate resting on it alone would drop half the
 *  launchable agents out of the Agents tab AND out of `needsYouCount` — an
 *  agent asking the human a question, invisible. That is #2371 review round 2's
 *  W1 one layer down (`PaneFacts.harness` says so in its own doc: it must not
 *  be used to decide what a pane IS), and it is why this reads `mark` — the
 *  pane header's own input — through `markProgram`.
 *
 *  AND THE CATALOG IS NOT "ANY PROGRAM AT ALL". `agentMarkFor` is TOTAL: it
 *  gives a hand-typed `make` pane a lettered badge, because a badge is a

 *  review round 3, B1). A launch line is loomux's own INFERENCE about a local process,
 *  so it is held to the eight CLIs loomux offers. A declared far-end CLI is a human's
 *  ASSERTION about a machine loomux cannot see, and the product supports asserting one

 *  had no row for it — the same header-vs-row divergence as the bug this arm was
 *  narrowed to fix, pointing the other way.
 *
 *  So the test is exactly the badge's: `namesAnAgent`, which is `agentMarkFor`'s own
 *  unknown-tier decision exported rather than a second denylist here. A profile

/** The pane key of the lead pane this pane reports to, or null when it nests
 *  under nobody (#2519 C1) — the Agents tab's child-indent input (C2 renders
 *  it; this module only decides what it MEANS, like every projection here).
 *
 *  The relationship is (same group, same tab), and BOTH halves are load-
 *  bearing. A lead's children join the lead's group (`spawn_agent` from a lead
 *  places them in it) and open in the lead's tab (C2 registers the tab as the
 *  group's owner), so:
 *
 *  - group alone is not enough — `groupRows` already scopes everything to one
 *    tab block, and an indent rendered from a cross-tab match would point at a
 *    parent that is not on screen;
 *  - tab alone is not enough — a worker of an ORCHESTRATOR group can share a
 *    tab with an unrelated lead, and it nests under nobody.
 *
 *  Only `worker`-class panes can be children: the backend refuses a lead every
 *  other kind, and a lead (role `"lead"`), an orchestrator, a manager or a
 *  plain pane resolves to null even when the group/tab pair matches its own
 *  record — nobody is their own parent. Matching reads exactly the fields
 *  `PaneFacts` already projects (orch group + role, tab id); no caller-side
 *  filtering of leads is required, and none should be added — the population
 *  the scan runs over is the whole fleet the caller hands in.
 *
 *  Each field it reads has a fixture that varies it (the lead-nesting corpus
 *  in `test/agentrows.test.ts`, the #1182 rule): the null-orch gate, the
 *  worker-role gate, the group pair, and the tab pair — the tab half held by
 *  fixtures whose operands COLLIDE (same group, different tab; tab null with
 *  the lead present), both red under group-only matching. The two-leads test
 *  cannot hold that half: its leads differ in group as well as tab. */

 *
 *  TWO LEVELS rather than one map on a joined key, because a join has to
 *  promise that no separator can appear in either half, and this needs no such
 *  promise: group ids and tab ids are compared as whole strings at their own
 *  level, so no pair of distinct (group, tab) can collide however either is
 *  spelled.
 *
 *  FIRST WINS, and that is not an arbitrary tie-break: it is what makes this
 *  index and a linear scan answer identically for every input, including the
 *  pathological one (two lead panes sharing a group AND a tab, which the
 *  backend's one-root-per-group invariant forbids and this module must still
 *  be total about). `Map.set` overwrites, so the guard is explicit rather than
