// Split-tree layout: panes live at the leaves, splits are flex rows or
// columns with draggable dividers. Splitting in the same direction as the
// parent inserts a flat sibling; splitting across creates a nested split.
//
// A same-direction insert has TWO placement policies (#885), picked per call
// site and computed in the pure, DOM-free `splitfloor.ts`:
//
//   - `halve` — the target pane pays for the newcomer out of its OWN weight,
//     so the row's total is unchanged and every other pane keeps its exact
//     grow/total RATIO. That is a ratio guarantee, not a pixel one: the new
//     divider is itself a flex sibling and takes ~4px off the row's free
//     space, so each sibling loses its ratio's share of those 4px (~1px in a
//     typical row) and drops a terminal column on the occasions when that
//     lands across a cell boundary. So: ONE guaranteed PTY resize (the
//     target) plus a rare sub-cell nudge per sibling — against `share`, which
//     moves and resizes every sibling in the row, every time. Every HUMAN
//     split gesture uses this: the pane you are standing in is the one that
//     shrinks, which is what tmux/wezterm do and what a split "feels" like.
//   - `share` — the newcomer joins at the MEAN of the weights already in the
//     row, so a row that was even is even again (N panes at 1/N) and repeated
//     placements form a real even matrix rather than a lopsided staircase.
//     Kept for PROGRAMMATIC batch placement — the multi-agent welcome fan-out,
//     a pane rejoining from the dock, a restore replay — where halving
//     repeatedly would deal out a 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16 sliver staircase.
//
// Cross-direction splits need no policy: nesting a two-way split inside the
// target's slot already halves the target alone. See
// docs/design/pane-splitting-and-floors.md.
//
// WHERE THE THREE PANE SLICES MEET. `halve` is #885's `splitfloor.planRowSplit`.
// `share` is #936's `paneequalize.planEvenInsert` — NOT splitfloor's own
// `share` branch, which is the pre-#885 "1/N on top of the existing total" and
// is exactly the staircase #936 reported. Removal is #936's too: a closing
// pane's weight goes to its survivors in equal absolute parts (`planRemoval`)
// rather than being dropped for flex to re-share proportionally. Autosize
// (`paneautosize.ts`) is the third, on-demand operation: it levels the WHOLE
// tab across nesting when the human asks, and never by itself.
//
// That routing is also what keeps the #954 magnitude clamp in the path. It
// lives at `paneequalize`'s entry points, so every operation that can inflate
// a row's weights — the close, which preserves the total across one fewer
// pane — re-bases an out-of-band row on the way in. `halve` reaches no clamp
// and needs none: it preserves the row's total EXACTLY, which is both why it
// cannot inflate anything and the guarantee a re-base would rewrite.
// `test/splitfloor.test.ts` pins the routing; the design note argues it.
//
// On top of splitting, panes can be dragged by their header to reorder
// (swap two slots) or re-dock to another pane's edge, maximized to cover the
// grid, and minimized out of the tree into a restorable dock. The drag
// decision logic (which zone the pointer is over → what happens) lives in the
// pure, unit-tested `layout.ts`; this file owns the DOM/tree mutation.

   *  PRECONDITION — READ THIS BEFORE ADDING A CALLER (#2365 review round 1,
   *  premortem 2). This passes `tabIsActive: true` UNCONDITIONALLY, because
   *  the grid cannot know the answer. So the plan omits `switch-tab`, and if
   *  the pane’s workspace is not the one on screen every step below runs under
   *  `display:none` — the caller has reinvented the exact blindness this method
   *  exists to fix, with nothing red to say so. `main.ts`’s `revealPane` is the
   *  only caller today and it switches tabs first; any new one must too.
   *
   *  Residual, stated rather than implied: this is a COMMENT, not a guard. A
   *  source scan was written for it and withdrawn — `reveal` is an ordinary
   *  method name in this tree (`EditorWidget.reveal(line, col)`,
   *  `src/filemenu.ts`), so a textual check cannot separate this method from
   *  the others and refused two known-good files on its first run. A guard that
   *  green-lights by accident is worse than none, so the precondition is
   *  carried here and in `docs/design/agents-tab.md` instead.
   *
   *  Constraint 1 (no PTY resize for a UI feature) — and WHO ASKED decides it.
   *  `restore` and `exitMaximize` genuinely resize a PTY: see their own docs
   *  below ("it alone issues one debounced fit"; "triggers a single genuine
   *  fit", plus the siblings that make room). That is permitted from a
   *  DISCRETE human click — the dock chip, the ⤢ button, an Agents row, the
   *  Sessions Focus button — and barred from anything else, so `humanInitiated`
   *  gates both. An agent-initiated reveal (`orch-focus`, emitted by the
   *  orchestrator's `focus_agent` MCP tool, with no human on the path) gets
   *  `setActive` + `focus` only and cannot resize anything: it must not drop
   *  the human out of a fullscreen they chose, nor pull a pane they docked back
   *  into the split tree. Same ruling as `shouldPreserveMaximize` (#155), which
   *  closed this exact class for the SPAWN path; this is the reveal path.
   *  Human clicks go through the existing resizeburst coalescing, so no NEW fit
   *  is added there either, and the plain case (a visible pane in the showing
