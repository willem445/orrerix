// The frontend half of `src/workflow-schema.json`'s contract (#880).
//
// The manifest is the one committed statement of what a `.loomux/workflow.yml` field
// IS. The engine's half of enforcing it lives in `src-tauri/tests/orchestration.rs`
// (`the_workflow_schema_manifest_matches_the_engines_raw_types`): manifest sections,
// field for field, against the `Raw*` serde types. This half asks the other question,
// the one that produced the bug the manifest exists for — `allow:` was a real block
// field for a year and the pane had no name for it, so a workflow that declared one
// looked exactly like a workflow that didn't:
//
//   (a) the PARSER knows every field — it never lands in the unknown-key bag;
//   (b) the canonical SERIALIZER emits every field — a save can't silently drop one;
//   (c) every field is either claimed by a form control or explicitly listed as not
//       yet having one (the list slice A owns and slice C empties).
//
// All three are behavioral: the assertions drive real text through the real parser and
// serializer rather than reading the model's own key sets back to it, so a test that
// passes is a field a human can actually round-trip through the pane.
