// Per-knob availability for the launcher's model selector (#687).
//
// DOM-free and I/O-free (`test/selectorknobs.test.ts`), and it mirrors no vendor
// capability of its own: the value sets and the notes come from the backend's
// `agent_cli_knobs`, which reports `CLI_CAPS` verbatim, so the launcher, the
// workflow parser and the spawn path can never disagree about what a CLI can do.
//
// What this module adds on top of that is the half the backend cannot answer:
// **whether the knob makes sense for the MODEL that is selected**. `effort` does
// on every claude model (a model that lacks a level falls back to the highest it
// supports at or below it — model-config §Adjust effort level), but `context`
// does not: `[1m]` is a model-alias suffix, and the suffix is only defined where
// the underlying model has a 1M window.
//
// That is #709's carried review finding. `clamped_knob` checks `context_variants`
// for claude and stops, so `model: haiku` + `context: 1m` composes
// `--model haiku[1m]` — not a plan-gated alias the account can't serve (which
// loomux deliberately does not pre-judge), but a string the vendor documents no
// meaning for at all.
//
// Docs behind the model gate (fetched 2026-08-02, `agent-cli-reference`
// discipline — Claude Code model-config):
//
//   §Model aliases    lists `sonnet[1m]` and `opus[1m]`; §opusplan adds
//                     `opusplan[1m]`. There is no `haiku[1m]`, `fable[1m]`,
//                     `best[1m]` or `default[1m]` row.
//   §Extended context "Fable 5, Sonnet 5, Opus 4.6 and later, and Sonnet 4.6
//                     support a 1 million token context window" — no Haiku, in
//                     any version — and "You can also use the `[1m]` suffix with
//                     model aliases or full model names", with
//                     `/model claude-opus-4-8[1m]` as the example.
//                     The rule stated outright: "Only append `[1m]` when the
//                     underlying model supports 1M context."
//
// The gate is therefore by model FAMILY, not by version: families are stable,
// version tables age (#329). And it fails OPEN on an id it does not recognize —
// a Bedrock inference profile, a gateway deployment name, a custom option. On
// those providers the suffix is exactly how the 1M window is selected, so
// refusing what we merely don't recognize would remove a real capability; an id
// that turns out not to support it fails at the CLI, visibly in the pane, which
// is the same posture slice A took on plan-gated entitlements.
