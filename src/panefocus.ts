// grid.ts imports this to decide whether a fresh pane should grab keyboard
// focus and become active.
//
// The bug this guards: a programmatically spawned agent pane (orchestrator MCP
// spawn_agent → orch-spawn-request → openPane) grabbed keyboard focus, yanking
// the cursor away from whatever pane the human was typing in — jarring mid-type.
// Focus should move to a new pane only when the human opened it directly (split
// button, launcher, session restore, launching an orchestrator). An
// orchestrator-driven spawn opens the pane in the background instead.

/** Whether a newly opened pane should take keyboard focus (and become the
 *  active pane).
 *
 *  `humanInitiated` is true for panes the human opened directly and false for

 *  and, when this returns true, refocuses it (with caret/selection) afterward.
 *
 *  Restore only when: the new pane isn't meant to take focus (`takeFocus` false,
 *  i.e. a background spawn onto a non-empty grid); something meaningful actually

//
// The reported failure was "the orchestrator pane vanished and I could not get
// it back". Nothing removed it: the only mechanism in the app that hides a
// pane while leaving its PTY bound is fullscreen — `Grid.toggleMaximize` lifts
// the target under `.grid-root` and `styles.css`'s `.grid-root.has-maximized >
// :not(.maximized)` hides the whole split tree — and the dock, which pulls a
// pane out of the tree entirely.
//
// What made it UNRECOVERABLE is that every "go to this pane" path was blind to
// both states. `Grid.setActive` on a pane behind a maximized sibling flips a
// class nobody can see, and `Pane.focus()` → `term.focus()` on a `display:none`
// textarea is a browser no-op — so the pane's own Agents row, `orch-focus`, and
// the Sessions tab's "focus its orchestrator pane instead" all did nothing
// visible. `toggleMaximize` additionally refuses a docked pane outright, so a
// pane the blind `setActive` had made active from the dock could not even be
// maximized back into view.
//
// So the decision has to name the STRUCTURAL steps as well as the focus ones,
// in order. It lives here rather than in `grid.ts` for the reason the rest of
// this module does: it is a rule, the grid is its executor, and a rule with no
// DOM in it can be pinned across every crossing under `node --test`.

/** One step of a reveal, in the order the executor must perform it.
 *
 *  Deliberately a closed union of five NON-DESTRUCTIVE steps. A reveal exists

 *  `toggleMaximize`'s own doc says the maximized pane "alone issues one debounced
 *  fit", and `restore`'s says re-attaching "triggers a single genuine fit" and
 *  makes its new siblings fit too. Constraint 1 permits that from a DISCRETE
 *  HUMAN CLICK and bars it from anything else, so both are gated on
 *  `humanInitiated`. An agent-initiated reveal — `orch-focus`, which the
 *  orchestrator's `focus_agent` MCP tool emits with no human anywhere on the
 *  path — gets `switch-tab` / `set-active` / `focus` and nothing structural: it
 *  can say which pane it wants attention on without dropping the human out of a
 *  fullscreen they chose or pulling a pane they docked back into the grid.
 *  That is `shouldPreserveMaximize`'s (#155) ruling applied to the reveal path,
 *  and it is why the two live in the same module.
 *
 *  `switch-tab` first when the pane is in a background tab: its whole workspace
 *  is `display:none`, so nothing below it is visible until the tab is showing.
 *
 *  `restore-from-dock` when docked, and then NO `exit-maximize` — `Grid.restore`
 *  already exits fullscreen on its way in, so emitting both would be one
 *  redundant relayout (constraint 1 counts a relayout as a potential PTY fit).
 *
 *  For a HUMAN reveal: `exit-maximize` only when a DIFFERENT pane is maximized. Revealing the
 *  fullscreen pane itself leaves fullscreen alone: a human who maximized a pane
 *  and then clicked its own Agents row is already looking at it, and yanking
 *  them out of fullscreen would be a layout change they did not ask for.
 *
 *  When a sibling IS maximized, the decision is to EXIT fullscreen rather than
 *  swap it to the target. A swap keeps the human in a mode they did not choose
 *  for this pane and hides whatever they had maximized with no visible cause;
 *  exiting is one step back to the layout they already know, and re-entering is
