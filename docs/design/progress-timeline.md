# Design: progress timeline (issue #608)

> The user-facing page for the progress timeline is [`docs/features/progress-timeline.md`](../features/progress-timeline.md) —
> what it does. This note is the *why*.

Status: **landed** — built up slice by slice against the accepted plan on
[#608](https://github.com/willem445/orrerix/issues/608#issuecomment-5151585803):

- **Slice A:** the `gh_activity` backend command and its coverage contract.
- **Slice B:** the pure event model + layout math (`timelinemodel.ts`,
  `timelinelayout.ts`) and the `TimelineEvent` schema.
- **Slice C:** the embeddable view (`timelineview.ts` + `timelinechrome.ts`),
  pane/shortcut/persistence wiring, user docs, and the `embedded-panels.md`
  cross-link.

## The feature, in one paragraph

A group-scoped, read-only view of orchestration progress on a time axis: when
issues were opened and closed, when PRs were opened and merged, plus the audit
log's own agent/delivery/report/gate events. Filterable by time window,
defaulting to the last 12 hours. It is a *reading* of data loomux already has —
it mutates nothing and adds no polling loop of its own.

## Data sources

| Source | Command | Slice |
|---|---|---|
| Orchestration audit log | existing `orch_audit` (unchanged) | B/C |
| Task board (current status only, not history) | existing `orch_tasks` (unchanged) | C |
| GitHub issue/PR lifecycle | **new** `gh_activity` | A |

The audit log needs no new backend at all: `orch_audit` already serves
`Vec<AuditEntry>` to the frontend for the audit view, and every event the
timeline plots (`agent-spawn`, `prompt`, `tool-call`, `task-upsert`,
`review-verdict`, `merge-gate-*`, …) is already in it. Extraction is
presentation-shaped and lives in DOM-free TS modules per this repo's
convention — see the plan's §2 for why a Rust-side event extractor was
rejected.

gh is the one genuinely missing source. The existing `gh_issue_list` /
`gh_pr_list` are open-state-only with pinned `--json` field sets that carry
`updatedAt` and nothing else — they cannot answer "what was opened, closed or
merged in this window", including for work a human did outside any group.

## The `gh_activity` command (Slice A)

A public contract, so it is written down here rather than only in the code:

```rust
#[tauri::command] gh_activity(repo: String) -> Result<GhActivity, String>

struct GhActivity {
    issues: Vec<GhIssueActivity>,   // number, title, state, created_at, closed_at, updated_at, url
    prs:    Vec<GhPrActivity>,      // ... + merged_at, head_ref
    limit:  usize,
    issues_truncated: bool,
    prs_truncated:    bool,
}
```

Typed frontend wrapper: `ghActivity(repo)` in `src/issues.ts` (hard constraint
5 — no view code touches Tauri IPC directly). ACL: registered in `lib.rs`'s
`generate_handler!`, listed in `command_manifest::APP_COMMANDS`, granted to
`main` via `permissions/sets/gh-read.toml` → `main-ui`; `tests/acl_manifest.rs`
is the guard that all three stay in step.

It follows `gh.rs`'s existing conventions exactly — arg-vector spawn, pinned
`--json` field set, lossy decode, `repo` resolved backend-side and used only as
a working directory (constraint 6's trust boundary), `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` on
Windows. Timestamps stay RFC-3339 **strings** over the wire and are parsed by
the frontend with `Date.parse`, so `gh.rs` still needs no date crate — and no
new dependency of any kind enters `src-tauri` (the getrandom hazard is not in
play because nothing is added to the graph).

### Three decisions worth the ink

**1. The sort order is pinned, because gh's default is the wrong one.**
`gh issue list` / `gh pr list` return items ordered by issue **number**
descending — newest *created* first, not newest *active* first. Verified
against gh 2.95.0 on this repo: a listing came back `633, 632, 628, 625, 622`
with non-monotonic `updatedAt`. Under that default, an issue opened months ago
and closed ten minutes ago drops off the page the moment 100 newer items exist
— so the default 12-hour window would silently lose exactly the events the view
is for. `--search "sort:updated-desc"` makes the page "the N most recently
active items", which is the property a time-window view needs. `--state all` is
the second non-default pin: the default `open` contains no close or merge event
at all.

**2. `merged_at`, not `state` or `closed_at`, decides "merged".** GitHub closes
a PR when it merges it, so a merged PR carries *both* timestamps. Keying a
merge event off `closed_at` would render every abandoned PR as a merge. The
pinned field set therefore includes `mergedAt`, and a test pins the
open / merged / closed-unmerged triple.

**3. The cap is reported, not silently applied.** Each list is bounded at 100
(`ACTIVITY_LIMIT`). Both the bound and whether it was reached come back in the
payload, so the view can render a coverage boundary; `limit` crosses the wire
instead of being duplicated as a frontend constant so the note and the query
cannot drift apart. `*_truncated` is deliberately conservative — a repo with
exactly 100 issues reports truncated, since one page cannot distinguish
"exactly full" from "full and more" — and over-reporting the boundary is the
safe direction.

`updated_at` is returned on every row for the same reason. Because the list is
sorted by activity, the oldest row's `updated_at` is a *precise* coverage
floor: nothing omitted was active more recently than that instant, so the view
can state "complete above T" rather than a vague "may be incomplete". This is
the frontend-side half of the honesty requirement, and Slice C owes the
rendering of it.

The rule behind all of that is `.loomux/lessons.md`'s "no silent caps": a chart
is uniquely good at looking complete, and a quiet period that is really a
missing page is indistinguishable from real quiet unless the view says so.

### Absent timestamps

`closed_at` / `merged_at` normalize to `None` not just for JSON `null` but for
an empty string and for Go's zero time (`0001-01-01T00:00:00Z`), which gh has
emitted for unset timestamps. Either would otherwise decode as a real instant
and plot a merge that never happened at the far left of the axis. Conversely a
*missing* `createdAt` decodes to `""` rather than failing the parse: one row
with a broken timestamp costs that row (the frontend parks it as undatable),
never the whole timeline.

## Failure behavior

One gh failure fails the whole `gh_activity` call rather than returning a
half-populated result. A timeline missing every PR looks like a quiet period;
an error is something the view can say out loud. The view's own gh layer is
additive on top of the audit data (per the plan, Slice C ships an audit-only
empty state if gh is unavailable), so a gh error degrades the view rather than
breaking it.

## The event model (Slice B)

Two DOM-free modules, unit-tested under `node --test`
(`test/timelinemodel.test.ts`, `test/timelinelayout.test.ts`). They hold every
answer that can be *wrong*; the SVG that consumes them is hand-validated, per
the repo's DOM-free-module convention.

Both are **self-contained — no imports at all, not even type imports.** tsc's
build forbids the explicit `.ts` extension an intra-src import needs for
`node --test` to resolve it directly (TS5097; see the note in `embedsplit.ts`),
so a bare specifier would work for one runner and not the other. The
consequence worth writing down: `timelinemodel.ts` **mirrors** `AuditEntry`
(auditsummary.ts) and `GhActivity` (issues.ts) as `*Like` interfaces rather
than importing them. Structural typing means the real values pass straight in,
and those mirrors are the one place a wire-shape change has to be re-checked.

### The schema

```ts
type TimelineEventKind =
  | "group" | "intake"                       // category: group
  | "agent-spawn" | "agent-exit"             // category: agents
  | "delivery" | "report" | "task-status"    // category: work
  | "verdict" | "merge" | "release"          // category: gates
  | "issue-opened" | "issue-closed"
  | "pr-opened" | "pr-merged" | "pr-closed"  // category: github
  | "ops";                                   // category: ops (default OFF)

interface TimelineEvent {
  ts_ms: number;
  kind: TimelineEventKind;
  label: string;                       // one line, never empty
  agent?: string; issue?: string; pr?: string;
  source: "audit" | "gh" | "audit+gh";
  detail: unknown;                     // the raw source record
}
```

**Kinds label a dot; categories are the lanes and the toggle chips.** The split
exists so the header stays readable without collapsing distinctions the labels
need.

Three refinements to the schema the plan sketched, all additive:

- **`delivery`, not `kickoff`.** The `prompt` audit detail is `{to, text}` and
  nothing else (mod.rs, `deliver_prompt_as`), so a first kickoff and a
  mid-stream delivery are indistinguishable in the data. The plan flagged this
  as "decide in B1 with the real data shape"; matching the kickoff's *text*
  would be a byte-shape guess against an open set, which this repo has been
  burned by before (`.loomux/lessons.md`, on fallible signals). The sender is
  in the data, so it goes in the label.
- **`intake` added.** `intake-signal` is real work arriving; `group` would
  mislabel it and `ops` would default-hide it. It shares the `group` lane and
  keeps its own label.
- **`pr-closed` added.** gh returns closed-unmerged PRs; without this kind such
  a PR opens on the chart and never resolves.

`source: "audit+gh"` marks an event both sources reported (see the dedupe
below). A `report` event leaves `issue`/`pr` unset on purpose: the MCP `ref`
argument (`"#123"`) does not say which it is, so it stays in the label and the
raw detail rather than being guessed into the wrong field.

### Nothing is silently dropped

The rule the whole model is shaped around. Every audit row ends in exactly one
of four places, and three of them are counted:

| Outcome | What it means |
|---|---|
| plotted | it has a kind of its own |
| `ops` lane | no kind of its own — a real event in a default-OFF lane, tallied per action in `unmapped` |
| `undatable` | no usable instant: the shims write a literal `ts_ms: 0` when `date` is unavailable (`loomux_audit`), and a 1970 dot would stretch the axis across 56 years of nothing |
| `malformed` | not an audit entry at all — one spliced line in `audit.jsonl` must not blank the view |

gh timestamps that will not parse (an empty `created_at`) are undatable too. A
`null` `closed_at` is *not*: that is an open issue, a state rather than a
missing timestamp.

`coverageNotes()` turns those counters, the 5000-entry `orch_audit` cap and
gh's own truncation flags into the sentences the view must render. They live in
the pure layer so the honesty text is unit-pinned rather than view prose nobody
tests. Two are deliberately weaker than they could be:

- **the cap note says "loaded at its cap", not "truncated".** `orch_audit`
  sends no truncation flag (`audit_log_windowed` keeps that for derivations),
  and a log holding exactly `AUDIT_VIEW_LIMIT` entries is indistinguishable
  from one that was cut.
- **the coverage-floor note says "audit coverage starts *T*", not "data is
  missing before *T*".** A window wider than the group's own lifetime is the
  ordinary case, and the frontend cannot tell a young group from one whose
  older generation was rotated away (`AUDIT_ROTATE_BYTES` keeps one). What it
  can say truthfully is that empty space at the left edge is "not recorded",
  not "nothing happened".

`AUDIT_VIEW_LIMIT` is mirrored as a frontend constant rather than plumbed —
the command does not send it, and the mirror carries the comment saying so.

### Merge dedupe

A merged PR can be reported twice: gh's `mergedAt` and the shim's own
`merge-gate-*` line. They collapse onto the gh row — gh has the authoritative
instant, and the gate's record survives in `detail.gate[]`. Three things the
dedupe deliberately does not do:

- **it never collapses a refused merge.** `merge-gate-blocked` at 11:00 and a
  granted merge at 11:30 are two real events in one PR's story; only a
  *permitting* gate event is the same event as the merge.
- **it never drops an audit-only merge.** That is a PR past gh's 100-row
  window, or a gate that allowed a merge gh never completed — exactly what
  this view exists to surface.
- **it never calls a gate event a merge.** The shim audits its *permission*
  and then exec's the real `gh`, which can still fail. An un-deduped gate event
  reads "merge of #640 allowed (autonomous)"; only a gh `mergedAt` says
  "merged".

Reference normalization matters here: the gh shim writes `"pr": "640"` (a
string, from `$num`), `review_verdict` writes `"pr": 640` (a number), and
agents write `"#640"`. All three normalize to the bare `"640"`, and anything
without digits is dropped rather than keyed to the wrong PR.

### Windowing

Presets are 1h / 6h / 12h (default) / 24h / 72h / all. `resolveWindow()` holds
three decisions:

- an **unknown preset id falls back to the default** — a value persisted by
  another build must not produce a blank chart;
- an event stamped **in the future extends the window** rather than falling off
  the right edge. A clock-skewed agent's report staying visible is the same
  principle as not plotting an undatable event at 1970;
- a window with **no span is widened** to `MIN_WINDOW_MS`, so the scale always
  has something to divide by (all events at one instant is a real case).

Both window edges are inclusive: a dot that vanishes because the window slid
by a millisecond is a worse bug than one counted twice at a boundary.

### Layout (`timelinelayout.ts`)

Knows nothing about `TimelineEvent`. It lays out anything with an instant and a
lane key, and the view supplies the key from `categoryOf()` — so the lane
grouping the view wants (by category now, sub-laned by agent later) is a caller
decision rather than a rewrite here.

- **Ticks are epoch-ms multiples.** A day tick is 00:00 UTC everywhere, which
  is what makes tick placement identical in every timezone and immune to DST.
  Labels are the view's job precisely because labels are where locale belongs.
  The ladder stops at 30 days and scales that step by whole multiples beyond
  it; calendar months are not a fixed number of ms and would break the
  property.
- **Clustering is per lane, greedy from the left**, against the cluster's first
  x — so a dense run becomes several bounded clusters rather than one that eats
  the lane, and a cluster's x is where it *started*, not a drifting mean. Each
  dot keeps `indices` into the array the caller passed, so expand-on-click
  needs no re-derivation.
- **Degenerate geometry is finite, never NaN.** A panel narrower than its own
  padding (a real state mid divider-drag) collapses to a zero-width plot
  instead of an inverted, mirrored axis.
- **Items outside the window are counted in `dropped`, never clamped onto the
  edge**, where they would read as real events at a time they did not happen.

### Where the PTY constraint lands

Nowhere in Slice B — these modules touch no terminal and no layout. The
constraint is Slice C's: the timeline is an embeddable view (#361), floating as
an overlay and, when docked, resizing through the same grid path every other
embedded panel uses. See `docs/design/embedded-panels.md`.

## The view (Slice C)

`timelineview.ts` is DOM wiring and nothing else: SVG construction, the two
polls, and the click handlers. Everything that can be *wrong* sits either in
Slice B's modules or in a third pure one, `timelinechrome.ts`
(`test/timelinechrome.test.ts`) — self-contained by the same no-intra-src-import
rule, and holding the view decisions that are still answers rather than
rendering:

| Decision | Why it isn't view prose |
|---|---|
| `tickScale(stepMs)` | one format for every window is wrong in both directions: 12h-apart ticks labelled to the second are six identical strings, and a 1h window labelled `Jul 30` says nothing |
| `laneLabel(category)` | an unknown key returns itself — `layoutTimeline` *appends* a lane it has never seen, so a category added to the model before the table catches up must render named, not blank |
| `toggleCategory` | re-sorts into lane order (chips and lanes must agree on position) and allows the empty selection, which the view states outright rather than silently resetting to all-on |
| `shouldRefreshGh` | gh must not be re-shelled on every 1.5 s audit tick, and a clock that jumps *backwards* must not freeze the gh layer for the rest of the session |
| `ghUnavailableNote` | names what is missing (issue/PR points) and what still holds (audit events) — see below |
| `ghCoverageFloorMs` / `ghFloorNote` | the precise coverage floor Slice A's `updated_at` was returned for |
| `detailSlice` | the detail body's cap, with its remainder *reported* |

### Where it lives, and what that cost

A seventh `EmbedKind` (#361), not a new pane kind — the plan's argument, which
survived contact: the data is a group's, groups live on orch panes, and a
free-floating pane would need its own group picker for no v1 benefit. The
engine needed no change; the whole wiring is the new kind added to `pane.ts`'s
existing tables and switches (`EmbedKind`, `EMBED_KINDS`,
`RESTORABLE_EMBED_KINDS`, the label/title records, `embedToggleBtn`,
`restoreEmbeds`, `activeOverlay`, `dispose`), an `ensureTimelineView` that
registers an `EmbedEntry`, a header button, `Alt+W`, and `"timeline"` in
`PersistedEmbedView`.

It is gated exactly like the audit log — every orchestration pane, not
orchestrator-only, because the data is the group's and the view mutates
nothing — and restores on the same terms: the **dock preference** survives a
restart, the window preset and category chips do not, the same way a restored
audit log does not restore its filters.

**No new backend.** `orch_audit` and `gh_activity` both already exist, so this
slice adds no command, no ACL entry and no manifest line. `gh_activity` goes
through `issues.ts`'s typed wrapper; `orch_audit` is called from the view the
same way `AuditView` and `TasksView` call their own group-scoped reads.

### The PTY constraint, discharged

The chart is the first embeddable view whose *content* depends on geometry, so
this is where the constraint could have been broken. It isn't:
`timelinelayout.ts` takes `widthPx` as a parameter (Slice B's deliberate
shape), and the view supplies it from a `ResizeObserver` **on its own chart
div** — never from `termEl`, never from a measured terminal, and never by
resizing anything. Docking goes through the shared `#361` path like every other
panel. The `ResizeObserver` coalesces into one relayout per animation frame, so
a divider drag re-lays the chart out at most once a frame, and
`.timeline-body` joins the `.resizing { content-visibility: hidden }` set that
already suspends every other docked view's expensive subtree mid-drag.

### Honesty, rendered

Slice B wrote the sentences; this slice is where they reach a human. All of
`coverageNotes()` renders above the chart, plus three the view adds:

- **gh unavailable.** `gh_activity` fails whole rather than half (Slice A), and
  the view keeps the audit half and says so. The sentence has to name the
  *loss* — with no gh data, a chart with no PR dots is indistinguishable from a
  repo where nobody opened a PR.
- **the precise gh floor.** Where a list came back truncated, the oldest
  `updated_at` in the page is an exact bound (the query is pinned to
  `sort:updated-desc` for this), so the view says "complete back to *T*" rather
  than only the vaguer cap note.
- **lanes switched off.** A hidden category is still loaded; the note says so,
  so an empty-looking chart is never a filter the human forgot about.

The detail body's cap reports its remainder for the same reason. A cluster dot
is labelled with its TRUE count, so a body that quietly stopped at 50 rows
would contradict the dot beside it.

### Two small view decisions worth the ink

**A clicked cluster is remembered as *what* it was, not *where*.**
`LayoutDot.indices` point into the array passed to `layoutTimeline`, which the
next follow poll invalidates. The selection is therefore held as (lane, first
instant, last instant) and re-resolved on every render — so a 1.5 s poll cannot
silently swap the open detail body for a different set of events.

**A no-op render is skipped.** The render signature covers the data, the
window, the chips, the measured width and the selection — the same reason the
audit view has one: rebuilding the SVG under a human's cursor (collapsing an
open row, dropping a hover) for identical data is fighting the human. The
window's end is quantized to the minute inside that signature, so a still
session does not rebuild forty times a minute just because "now" moved.
