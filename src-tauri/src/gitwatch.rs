//! External-change watcher for the per-pane git view (issue #36).
//!
//! All git UI refresh is otherwise event-driven off the pane's own shell
//! prompt (OSC 7 → `pane.ts onCwdReported` → branch-chip refresh +
//! `GitView.notifyPrompt`). A `git checkout` / commit / stage run from VS Code
//! or another terminal never touches the pane's shell, so nothing fires and the
//! view goes stale. This module closes that gap.
//!
//! A single background thread polls the `.git` metadata of every repo that has
//! an open pane and emits `git-changed { id }` when it moves. The frontend
//! feeds that into the *same* throttled refresh path as a prompt, so rate
//! limiting and rendering are unchanged — we only add a new trigger.
//!
//! Why polling and not the `notify` crate: this project's Windows 10 baseline
//! can't load binaries that import `bcryptprimitives.dll!ProcessPrng`, so any
//! dependency pulling `getrandom`/`rand` is off-limits (see the note in
//! Cargo.toml). Stat-ing a handful of small files once a second is cheap and
//! pulls in nothing new. The signature also folds in `HEAD`'s *contents* (a
//! ~41-byte file) so a branch switch is detected even where filesystem mtime
//! resolution is coarse.
