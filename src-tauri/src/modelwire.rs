//! Ask an agent CLI, in its own control protocol, which models this host offers
//! (#993).
//!
//! `cliprobe.rs` answers "which model strings does this CLI *accept*" by reading
//! what the CLI prints unprompted — its `--help` prose, or a list subcommand
//! where one exists. That is as far as printing gets you. Claude Code has no
//! list subcommand (`claude models` starts a chat), but it does speak a control
//! protocol on its `stream-json` input stream, and one `list_models` control
//! request over it returns the model picker the human's own install would show:
//! the real per-host ids, and each model's supported effort levels. Neither is
//! knowable from any page this repo could cite.
//!
//! **This module deliberately understands nothing about the reply.** It writes
//! one request line, reads stdout, and hands the bytes to the frontend, where
//! `src/modelwire.ts` parses them under `node --test`. That split is the whole
//! design: the parsing is the fragile part, it is written against a payload
//! shape the vendor does not document, and it belongs where a test round costs
//! a second rather than a CI build. What stays here is what only a backend can
//! do — spawn a process, write its stdin, and bound it.
//!
//! **Two facts about this request that loomux cannot verify.** Anthropic types
//! the control envelope (`@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`'s `sdk.d.ts`; the
//! request is `SDKControlListModelsRequest = { subtype: 'list_models' }`) and
//! documents every flag below at
//! <https://code.claude.com/docs/en/cli-reference>. But the string
//! `list_models` appears nowhere in Anthropic's documentation corpus, so the
//! claim that it is a metadata message which does **not** consume completion
//! credits is third-party (`stablyai/orca`, MIT) and UNVERIFIED by the vendor.
//!
//! **What loomux does about that changed in #1002, by the human's own
//! direction, and this module is where the change lives.** #993 shipped the
//! conservative reading of constraint 3: nothing here ran on its own, and the
//! request was only ever reached from an explicit click. The human then
//! validated the cost themselves and directed that detection become automatic
//! and interaction-free — so the ask now runs unbidden, once per CLI per app
//! run, from [`start_startup_sweep`]. The record of that decision, and what
//! remains unverified about it, is `docs/design/model-catalog.md` §Credit
//! safety.
//!
//! **The bound that replaced the click, and why it is a boundary rather than a
//! budget.** A gesture was a natural rate limit — one ask per finger — and
//! automatic detection has none. The tempting shape is to keep
//! [`list_cli_models`] an ASK and ration it with a memo, so a picker that opens
//! before the sweep has answered can start its own. That was considered and
//! rejected (`docs/design/model-catalog.md` §"Why the command cannot spawn"): it
//! puts a subprocess spawn back on a render path — precisely the boundary #993
//! drew — and then needs two separate guards to make it safe again.
//!
//! So the spawn lives in exactly ONE place. [`start_startup_sweep`] is the only
//! function in loomux that reaches an agent CLI unbidden; [`list_cli_models`]
//! is a **lookup**, incapable of spawning anything, and a picker that asks
//! before the sweep has answered is simply told there is nothing yet. The
//! answer reaches it moments later on the `models-detected` event instead. The
//! property that buys: no render path, present or future, can spend the human's
//! money — enforced by there being no code here that could.
//!
//! Its cost, accepted by the human's own direction: a CLI installed *after*
//! loomux started is not detected until the next restart. There is no re-ask
//! affordance, by the same direction.
//!
//! Adding Copilot or opencode is a `PROTOCOLS` row, not a branch — the
//! `ENUMERATORS`/`CLI_CAPS` data pattern this repo already uses for per-CLI
//! differences.
