//! Durable UI state persisted across launches — the project-tab set (#63),
//! since #370 app-wide terminal settings, since #887 the user's SSH
//! connection profiles, since #1270 the task board's view preferences, and
//! since #2116 orrerix's own sessions log. All five are app-global —
//! `boardprefs.json` holds one record PER GROUP and `sessionlog.json` one PER
//! SESSION, but the group/session id is a map key inside the blob and never a
//! path — so they live directly under the app data dir as
//! `tabs.json`/`settings.json`/`sshprofiles.json`/`boardprefs.json`/`sessionlog.json`,
//! siblings of `orchestration/` and `logs/` — the same `<data dir>/loomux/…`
//! tree the rest of the app's durable state uses (see
//! `OrchRegistry::default_root`, `obs::logs_dir`).
//!
//! Each blob is an OPAQUE JSON string the frontend owns the schema for
//! (`src/tabstore.ts` / `src/settings.ts` / `src/sshprofile.ts` /
//! `src/boardprefs.ts` / `src/sessionlog.ts` encode/decode and validate their
//! own shape — this file never parses any of them beyond "is it JSON at all").
//! The backend's job here is narrow but critical, and identical for all five:
//!
//!  1. **Atomic writes.** Serialize to a sibling temp file, then rename over the
//!     target. A bare `fs::write` truncates the file in place, so a crash / kill
//!     mid-write destroys the data — exactly the hazard that wiped the task board
//!     in #133. A temp-file + rename leaves either the old (valid) file or the
//!     temp file behind, never a half-written target.
//!  2. **Corrupt-file fail-safe.** On load, if the file is present but not valid
//!     JSON at all (truncated / garbled), it is *quarantined* — renamed aside to
//!     `tabs.corrupt.json` so a later save can't clobber it and a human can
//!     inspect it — and `None` is returned so the caller degrades to defaults
//!     WITHOUT silently losing the user's tabs or the evidence.
//!
//! Frontend never touches Tauri IPC directly (CLAUDE.md constraint 5): every
//! `#[tauri::command]` below is wrapped by a typed helper in `src/pty.ts`.
