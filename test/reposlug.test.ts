// One repo slug, everywhere (#1153 phase 5).
//
// The GitHub repo rename is a human step this branch cannot perform — #1153
// calls it "a human-only action" and never names the target slug — so the ~73
// places that hardcode `willem445/loomux` have to move in the human's change,
// not in ours. The review that produced this test found the failure mode: a PR
// body called those edits "cosmetic", which is true of most of them and false
// of the two that matter.
//
// It is false in two different ways, and neither announces itself:
//
//   - **GitHub Pages does not redirect.** GitHub's own rename docs: "All
//     existing information, with the exception of project site URLs, is
//     automatically redirected to the new name." So every
//     `willem445.github.io/orrerix/...` link and `docs/_config.yml`'s `baseurl`
//     404 the instant the repo is renamed. Nothing errors at rename time; the
//     published docs site just breaks.
//   - **npm checks `repository.url` for an exact match.** From npm's
//     trusted-publishing troubleshooting: "To publish from GitHub, your
//     package's `repository.url` field in `package.json` must exactly match
//     your GitHub repository." A redirect satisfies a browser and not this, so
//     a lagging manifest fails the first OIDC release with the rename long
//     since forgotten. `npm trust` reads the same field when `--repository` is
//     omitted, so it also mis-points the binding.
//
// Both are invisible at the moment the mistake is made and expensive later,
// which is exactly what a guard is for. The rule is deliberately stronger than
// "the two that matter must move": ONE slug, everywhere, so nobody has to
// re-derive which class a given site is in. `npm/package.json`'s
// `repository.url` is the source of truth because it is the field npm itself
// validates against.
//
// See docs/design/rebrand-external.md, "The human runbook".
