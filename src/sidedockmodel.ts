// Three questions live here, and they are separate on purpose:
//
//   1. WHERE SHOULD THE DOCK BE POINTED?  (`decideFollow`) — the active pane
//      changed; does the dock re-root, remember for later, or do nothing?
//   2. WHAT SHOULD ONE TAB'S VIEW DO ABOUT IT?  (`decideViewSync`) — the dock's
//      root moved; does this particular view get built, rebuilt, or protected?
//   3. WHAT SURVIVES A RESTART?  (`decodeDockPrefs`/`encodeDockPrefs`).
//
// Splitting 1 from 2 is what keeps the unsaved-work rule in one place. The dock
// re-roots freely; a view decides for itself whether it can follow, and the
// editor is the one that sometimes cannot (see `decideViewSync`).

 *  changed meaning without changing value: it used to be how much of the grid
 *  the dock could never hide, and it is now how much of the row the grid never
 *  gives up. Either way it is the same promise — a panel that can consume its
 *  own host entirely is a way to lose the app, the same reason `TERM_RESERVE_H`
 *  exists in overlaysize.ts on the other axis. The value is duplicated rather
 *  than imported for the reason embedded-panels.md records: a pure module that

 *  and bare `node --test`.
 *
 *  **THE RESERVE IS ENFORCED IN THREE PLACES, none of them redundant.** Two are
 *  CSS, because CSS holds at boot, on a restore from persistence and on every
 *  window resize with no listener to forget:
 *
 *   - `.sidedock`'s `max-width` bounds what the dock ASKS FOR. It used to be
 *     applied only on the drag path, so a width persisted on a wide monitor came
 *     back whole on a narrow one and covered every pane (#1097 rev-767 B2).
 *   - `#grid-area`'s `min-width` is the floor the grid KEEPS. It exists because
 *     the max-width above is measured against the whole workspace and cannot see
 *     `#sessions` taking 344px of the same row; with both panels open on a
 *     narrow window, the grid — and not the panel — is what would vanish.
 *
 *  The third is `dockBoxes`/`clampDockWidth` here, against the room the dock and
 *  the grid actually SHARE. CSS decides what is rendered; this decides what is
 *  persisted and how wide the panel inside the column is laid out, and neither
 *  of those is something a stylesheet can answer. Passing the workspace's width
 *  instead was a real defect (#1189 review, finding 2): every width between
 *  `room - 240` and `workspace - 240` is one the row can never seat, so a drag
 *  through that gap persisted a number the layout silently ignored.
 *
 *  `test/sidedockmodel.test.ts` pins both stylesheet copies against this
 *  constant, so the mirror cannot drift. */

 * `#sessions` (344px, `flex: none`) is open beside them. That distinction is
 * the whole point of the parameter since #1150 made the dock displace: the
 * workspace-wide bound accepts widths the row can never seat, so a drag past
 * that point stops tracking the pointer while the number being persisted keeps
 * climbing, and the next boot restores a width the layout silently ignores
 * (review of #1189, finding 2). The caller measures it as
 * `#grid-area` + `.sidedock`, which is invariant to where the divider between
 * them sits and therefore stable for the length of a drag.
 *
 * The default leaves only the absolute bounds, for callers reasoning about a
 * persisted value before anything has been measured. A non-finite input (a

 * delay and burst start together: they are parts of one decision, and a caller
 * that could set them from separate calls could set them inconsistently.
 *
 * **`columnPx` is 0 when closed, and that is the whole feature.** The dock is a
 * flex sibling of `#grid-area` now, so the panes get their space back only if
 * the dock's column actually reaches zero. It has to get there by ANIMATING —
 * `display: none` would return the space in one jump, with no burst for
 * `resizeburst.ts` to coalesce and no autosize for the human to see.
 *
 * **`contentPx` is NOT 0 when closed, and that is not an oversight.** The panel
 * inside the column keeps its width throughout, so a toggle slides a fixed-size
 * panel behind a moving clip instead of re-laying-out a git graph or a file tree
 * at fifteen intermediate widths. It is also what makes the reopen cheap: the
 * contents are already at the width they will be shown at.
 *
 * **`starved` is the floor, and it exists because the fixed-width panel above
 * cannot adapt to a column narrower than itself — it can only be cropped by
 * one** (review of #1189, finding 3). With `#sessions` open the row gives the
 * dock `room - 240`, which falls under `DOCK_MIN_W` for any room below 520 — a
 * half-screen window on a 1366 laptop. Rather than render the right-hand sliver
 * of a panel laid out for a width it does not have, the dock takes no column at
 * all: readable, or absent. The caller says so on the toggle button, because a
 * control that silently does nothing is the other way to look broken.
 *
 * The direction of the trade is not in question — the grid keeps its reserve and
 * the dock is what yields (docs/design/side-dock.md). What this adds is a point
 * at which yielding stops being a cropped strip.
 *
 * `roomPx` is the width the dock and the grid SHARE (see `clampDockWidth`). A
 * missing or unmeasurable one — boot, before the window has been laid out —
 * fails OPEN: an unmeasured room is not evidence of a small one, and hiding the
 * dock on it would be a worse failure than showing it and correcting on the
 * first real measurement.

 * attention chip. That silently rebuilt the file explorer out from under them
 * and closed a clean editor file, at a moment nothing they did caused.

 * move the dock, and the reason is the same one that governs `isActiveTabChange`
 * above: a follow re-reads the active pane's **live** cwd, so *when* it runs is
 * as load-bearing as *what* it reads.
 *
 * This closed the second door on the same defect (#1097 rev-776). The first
 * revision took no workspace argument at all and justified it by saying the dock
 * "reads the active pane itself rather than trusting the pane the event fired
 * for". That is true and it is not sufficient — reading the *right* pane at the

 * falls out of the comparison rather than needing a guard of its own: no real

 * a `getCwd()`/`getRoot()` callback and re-read it on their next refresh, while
 * `FileEditView` latches it on first `show()` and never re-reads it. Dispose
 * and reconstruct is the one operation that is correct for all three, and it is
 * also the only one that drops the caches a re-root would otherwise strand
 * (`FileExplorerView`'s go-to-file index and content hashes are invalidated on
 * its OWN picker path only). So the dock uses it uniformly rather than three
 * per-view re-root recipes, two of which nothing would ever test.
 *
 * **`hold` is the price of that, and it is the point.** Reconstructing a
 * `FileEditView` throws its buffer away. Doing so because the human clicked a
 * different pane would destroy work they never agreed to lose — precisely the
 * rule #219 exists to state — so a dirty editor simply stops following, keeps
 * its file, and says so. It resumes on the next sync after it goes clean
 * (saving, or discarding, both reach that), which is why the dock re-asks this
 * question every time a tab is activated and not only when the root moves.
