//! Integration tests for the merge-queue **driver** (#581 slice D1).
//!
//! Design note: `docs/design/merge-queue.md`. These pin the two things that note
//! says can only be pinned here:
//!
//! - **§7.5's five refusals**, so the constraint-7 proof is executed rather than
//!   argued: enqueue against the default refused; a batch build whose target
//!   became the default aborted; the adversarial rename refused at landing; a
//!   failed lookup refused rather than defaulted; and the landing refspec
//!   asserted to be exactly `<tested-sha>:refs/heads/<target>`.
//! - **§4/§7.5's argv-level assertions**, on the exact argument vector handed to
//!   `git`/`gh` rather than on any resulting ref. Every way of getting the
//!   create-only scratch push wrong degrades to a *silently successful ordinary
//!   push*, so an outcome-only test passes in exactly the cases the check exists
//!   to prevent. A fake runner is the only way to see the bytes.
//!
//! # Why a new file rather than `tests/orchestration.rs`
//!
//! The note names `tests/orchestration.rs` as the home for the refusal tests.
//! That file is now 33.9k lines and is the serialization point slices A, D and E
//! already contend on; `tests/workflow.rs` is the standing precedent for a
//! per-subsystem integration-test file. Nothing about these tests needs the
//! registry, so they get their own target. `tests/smoke.rs` is untouched —
//! CLAUDE.md constraint 4 needs at least one integration-test target to exist
//! for the Windows comctl32-v6 manifest link args, and this file adds one more
//! rather than replacing it.
//!
//! # No network, no real CLIs
//!
//! CLAUDE.md constraint 3. Every test drives a [`Fake`] runner: it records each
//! argv it is handed and replies from a canned script. No `git`, no `gh`, no
//! remote, and no agent CLI is spawned by anything in this file.
