//! #1601 Phase 0 — the app's self-observability, tested as the instrument it is.
//!
//! These live as integration tests (not unit tests) because test executables
//! that link the full lib need the common-controls-v6 manifest embedded via
//! `rustc-link-arg-tests` (CLAUDE.md constraint 4), and because half of what is
//! being asserted is a property of `OrchRegistry`, which lives in `src-tauri`.
//!
//! **What an instrument owes over what a feature owes.** A test that only drove
//! the pure reporting rules over synthesized snapshots would be green against an
//! instrument that records nothing at all — the snapshots would be the test's
//! own invention. So the recording path is exercised for real (a lock is taken,
//! held, and read from another thread) and the reporting rules are ALSO driven
//! purely, where a five-second threshold can be asserted without a test that
//! takes five seconds.
