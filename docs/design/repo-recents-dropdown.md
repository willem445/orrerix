# The repo field's recents dropdown (#2010)

The launcher's new-pane **Repository** field offers the most recent directories.
This note records the shape of the fix and the one contract it widens; the
persuasive history is on the issue.

## The defect

The field was a plain `<input>` plus a `<datalist>` of recents. Browsers filter
a datalist's suggestions by the input's current text, and the launcher pre-fills
the input (`defaultFolder` — the split-from pane's cwd, or the newest recent),
so the dropdown showed only the entries that happened to start with that
prefix — in practice, one entry or none. The recents were recorded and fed in
correctly; the control could not display them. This is exactly the defect the
model field escaped, and `src/modelpicker.ts` documents why a datalist does not
work there (its header, lines 9-12).

## The fix: one dropdown mechanism, reused

The repo field is now the `ModelPicker` control — the same class the model
pickers use, not a second dropdown implementation. The module header's rule is
why: "the second copy of a control is the second place a fix has to be
remembered." The picker lists every recent directory regardless of the input's
text, newest first, and marks the current value by selecting its option; its
`custom…` escape keeps the field wider than the list, because an unknown path is
the normal case for a path field — free text and `Browse…` behave exactly as
they did.

Two consequences of the reuse, both deliberate:

- When the current value IS a recent, the picker's dropdown branch hides the
  free-text input (the value shows in the dropdown, as it does for a model id).
  Editing it freely costs one click on `custom…`, the same trade the model
  picker makes in both of its hosts. Typing into a field whose value is not a
  recent — the common case, since the pre-fill from `defaultFolder` (#214)
  usually is not — needs no click at all: the picker opens on its custom branch.
- The pane's initial-focus marker (`data-initial-focus`, rev-74 LOW-4/LOW-6)
  follows the VISIBLE half of the picker: the free-text input when it is
  showing, the recents select when the dropdown branch hides it, because
  `focus()` on a hidden element lands nowhere. The re-homing runs in BOTH
  directions on every branch flip, not just stamped once: a Browse… pick of a
  folder already in the recents, or the human picking one in the dropdown, can
  hide the half the marker was on while the pane stays open, and picking
  `custom…` again moves it back to the input — a stranded marker on the
  select would be worse than a dead end, because a select is a value-changing
  control (one arrow key fires `change` and silently replaces a half-typed
  path with a recent directory). When both halves are showing the free-text
  input carries the marker: it is the half the human is typing into. The
  predicate is the same one `ModelPicker.focus()` uses, and `Pane.focus()`
  routes into `focusWelcome()` on every window-refocus and keyboard-nav
  (rev-std round 1 finding 2 and rev-final B1 on #2010). The class re-homes
  on all three of its own flip sites — the dropdown's `change`, `set value`,
  and `setOptions`, because a rebuild flips branches exactly like the other
  two and cannot assume a host seeds before it stamps (#2108). The contract
  is pinned by `test/modelpicker.test.ts`, a minimal DOM shim driving the
  real class — including the red-before-green run against #2104's pre-fix
  `ca0e4a46` blob. A `set value` or `setOptions` rebuild that takes the
  dropdown branch also clears the hidden input's stale text — the same rule
  on both sites, so flipping back to `custom…` shows an empty box rather
  than a previously typed path (#2108). The launcher seeds the picker through
  `seedPicker` (modelpicker.ts), and the test harness calls the same
  function, so the seed's setOptions-then-stamp order lives in one place
  rather than being hand-copied into the tests (#2108 review).

The E2E helpers follow the same contract (`e2e/helpers.ts` `fillRepoField`):
their structural selectors are declared coupled to `src/launcher.ts`'s DOM
shape, and `fill()` on the picker's hidden input waits until the test times out
— how the first run of this change reddened five soak/workflow specs. The
helper picks `custom…` when the input is not showing, exactly like a human
typing an unknown path does.

## What was widened on ModelPicker

Additive, and forced by the repo host's needs; the workflow pane's usage is
unchanged:

- `get select()` / `get input()` — the two elements, so a host can compose the
  picker into its own field layout (the repo row's per-kind placeholder and the
  initial-focus marker above). Read-mostly: the picker owns the structure.
- The re-homing runs only on the picker's own flip sites. A host that writes
  `hidden` directly through the `select`/`input` accessors bypasses all of
  them and could strand the marker again; guarding a direct write would need
  attribute-mutation observation, not a one-line guard, so the assumption is
  recorded rather than enforced: hosts flip branches through `set value` or
  the dropdown itself. The launcher re-points `placeholder`/`spellcheck`
  through the accessors, and the seed's `hidden` read lives in `seedPicker`
  (modelpicker.ts); no `hidden` write through either accessor exists anywhere
  in `src/` (#2108).
- Visibility is read from the `hidden` attribute alone — the same trust
  `focus()` has always made. A stylesheet hiding a half by class or media
  query would defeat both the marker and `focus()`; if that ever becomes
  real, the predicate's input widens, not its call sites (#2108).
- `set value` — the Browse… pick, whose dialog result is not a keystroke. It
  re-runs `pickerSelection` (so an unknown path opens the custom branch) and
  fires nothing, matching how a programmatic write has always behaved; the
  caller does its own follow-up work. A value that takes the dropdown branch
  also clears the hidden input's stale text (#2108).
- `focus()` — focuses whichever half is showing, for the validation-error paths
  that bounce the human back to this field.
- `setOptions` defers itself past the mid-type window (#2124): a reply-driven
  rebuild is no longer trusted to every host's guard, because the launcher's
  probe reply was the one call site none of them reached. While the custom
  input is focused (`editingCustom`) the rebuild queues on the input's next
  `blur` through `runWhenNotEditing` — skipped under the caret, never dropped —
  and at blur it re-derives the committed VALUE exactly as an unguarded
  rebuild would (`pickerSelection` re-runs against `this.value`), so the
  branch resolution and the dropdown-branch staleness clear still apply. The
  ARGUMENTS are the opposite — `models`, `fallback` and `cli` freeze at reply
  time, unlike the host-side funnels whose closures re-read; not live today
  because later-armed deferrals run after earlier ones, and a fresher reply
  still wins (rev-final W1 on #2124). A queued rebuild cannot paint a CLI the
  host has already left: moving off the control requires the blur that runs
  the queue. And every branch flip this class makes OUT of the input
  re-homes focus to the visible half, which delivers that blur even when the
  flip is a programmatic `set value` landing on a focused box — a queued
  rebuild strands only if a host hides the input without going through the
  picker, the write class the #2108 note already records as absent
  (rev-std finding 1 on #2124). Pinned by the #2124 tests in
  `test/modelpicker.test.ts`.

## Recording and persistence

- Recorded on every launch (as before: terminal cwd, content/git root,
  orchestrator/agent repo) **and now on every Browse… pick** — the pick IS the
  gesture, the same argument the #1042 `admitRoot` call beside it makes.
- NOT recorded from the side dock, though the dock does open directories: its
  File-explorer 📁 picker (`fileexplorer.ts` `pickRoot`) and the dock-embedded
  editor's folder browse (`fileedit.ts`) both re-root the DOCK itself
  (`sidedock.ts` `adoptRoot`, "re-roots the DOCK, not just itself"). The reason
  they stay out: the pick chooses the dock's own viewing context, and the dock
  also re-roots itself to follow the active pane's cwd — neither is a directory
  the human asked the launcher to launch a pane into, which is the question the
  recents list answers (the issue's QoL ask: every launch means browsing
  again). The terminal pane's "Change folder" chip is the same shape: it is a
  shell `cd`, not a launch.
- The ordering/dedup/cap decision lives in `src/recentdirs.ts`
  (`mergeRecentDir`, node-tested in `test/recentdirs.test.ts`): trimmed, then
  deduplicated to the front, capped at `MAX_RECENT_REPOS` (8 — the cap
  `addRecentRepo` has always enforced; the issue's "say 10" was an estimate).
  Storage stays in localStorage under the existing `loomux.recentRepos` key
  (`src/agents.ts`), read fresh on every write.
- A read that fails outright (`localStorage.getItem` throwing) **declines the
  write**: a list the store could not show us must not be overwritten with one
  built from nothing. A blob that parses to garbage is different — the data is
  gone, nothing to preserve — and rebuilds from empty, as before. (Single
  tenant, so the multi-tenant BoardPrefsStore rule does not apply; the
  declined-write half of it does.)
