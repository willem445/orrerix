// The leading-edge time-window throttle the git surfaces react through, as a
// pure decision (P4's shape, docs/design/performance.md §2 — panethrottle.ts is
// the same split: the module owns the policy, the caller owns the timer).
//
// What it bounds. A pane learns its repository may have moved from two
// signals: the shell's own OSC 7 prompt report, and the backend `git-changed`
// watcher (1 s poll, emits on signature change). Each reaction is a `dir_info`
// invoke for the header's branch chip plus a git-view refresh. The view half
// was already throttled to 500 ms; the `dir_info` half rode every event
// ungated, so a rebase or a checkout loop turned a 1 Hz watcher into an
// unbounded stream of sync commands on the webview thread (#743's census, part
// 2b). Both halves now run through this policy, each bounded to one pass per
// window, with the trailing edge guaranteeing the last signal is not the one
// that gets dropped.
//
// Two windows, one policy — not one shared window. Each half keeps its own
// `lastRunMs`, and they are meant to drift: the view's advances only while it
// is visible, the pane's whenever a cwd is known, and either can fire in a
// window the other has already spent. What is shared is the decision and the
// constant, so the two cannot disagree about how long a window is. A single
// window across both would be a different (and worse) design: whichever half
// signalled first would suppress the other, which is how a chip goes stale
// behind a view that refreshed instead.
//
// Leading edge, deliberately: the first signal into a quiet pane runs
// immediately (a `cd` or a commit must move the chip now, not in half a
// second), and only a *second* signal inside the window is deferred — the same
// argument #714/#733 make one layer down for PTY output.
