## What it is

The **agents** button in the top bar opens the same left panel the session
browser lives in, on its second tab: one row per **agent pane** in this
window, saying what each one is doing right now.

A terminal you opened and typed into yourself is not listed — see
[which panes are listed](#which-panes-are-listed).

It is an overview of the *live* window — not a history and not a fleet-wide
report. Every row is derived from what the pane already knows, so opening the
tab costs nothing on the wire and asks no agent anything.

The panel has two tabs and they share one column. Clicking **agents** when the
Agents tab is already showing closes the panel; clicking it while the Sessions
tab is showing switches without moving the column, so your terminals are not
resized by changing tabs. `Ctrl+Shift+P` still opens the Sessions tab.

## A row

Each row carries the agent CLI's mark, the pane's name, its state, and a quiet
line naming whichever of these the pane has: the agent CLI it is running, its
orchestration role or workflow block, and its group.

The mark is the same one the pane header wears, resolved from the same reading —
GitHub's Copilot glyph where a vendor publishes a licensed one, a lettered badge
otherwise, and for a remote pane whose profile does not say which agent runs on
the far end, a neutral badge that says orrerix does not know.

A pane that is not an agent is never given a guess. Where orrerix does not know
which agent a listed pane runs — a remote pane whose profile does not say — the
badge says so rather than reading the transport's own name, because captioning
it "Agent CLI: ssh" would be a confident wrong answer. Panes that are not agents
at all do not reach this list; their headers still carry whatever mark they
earn.

**Click a row to go to that pane** — it switches to the pane's project tab,
makes it the active pane there, and focuses the terminal.

It *reveals* the pane rather than just focusing it, so a row always gets you
somewhere you can see. If the pane is parked in the dock, it comes back into
the grid; if another pane is filling the window, that fullscreen drops first.
Clicking the row of the pane that is *already* fullscreen leaves it
fullscreen — you are looking at it, so there is nothing to reveal.

## Groups, and the order

Rows are grouped under the project tab they live in, with the tab's name as the
header. A tab with no panes in the list shows no header — including a tab whose
rows have all been filtered out by a chip.

The pair of buttons beside the **Agents** heading chooses which group comes
first:

| Order | Groups come in this order |
| --- | --- |
| **most wants you** | The tab holding the most urgent pane first. Two tabs whose worst pane is in the same state stay in your tab-strip order. |
| **by tab** | Your tab-strip order — the arrangement you dragged the tabs into. Never alphabetical, so renaming a tab does not reshuffle the list. |

Inside a group the order is the same either way: most wants you first, then by
name. Your choice is remembered on this machine, and changing it does not resize
anything.

### Helpers under their lead

A pane launched with [orrerix subagents](orrerix-subagents.html) opens helpers of
its own, and those are shown **indented under it**, with a ↳. The nesting is
exact rather than approximate: a pane is shown under a lead only when it is in
that lead's group *and* in the same tab, so two leads in two tabs never claim
each other's helpers, and a worker belonging to an ordinary orchestration group
that happens to share a tab with a lead is not indented under it.

The indent is only an indent. It does not change the order (helpers sort with
everything else, most wants you first), and it does not group or collapse them
— a helper that wants your attention still rises to the top of its tab's block.

## Which panes are listed

A pane is listed when orrerix has a reason to say it is running an agent. Any
one of these is enough:

- it belongs to an orchestration group — whatever it was started with;
- orrerix already knows which agent CLI it runs, including a remote pane whose
  SSH profile declares the agent on the far end — **any** agent, not only the
  ones below: a profile may name a CLI orrerix does not know, and declaring one
  is you telling orrerix what runs there;
- it was launched with one of the agent CLIs orrerix itself offers — Claude
  Code, Copilot CLI, Codex, OpenCode, pi, Gemini CLI, Hermes, Ante.

Everything else stays out of the list, and out of the count on the **agents**
button:

- **a plain terminal** — a shell you opened and typed into. This is what the
  list used to call a *working* agent: the state reading is honest about
  meaning "no evidence of a prompt", and asked about your shell it said exactly
  that, about a question it was never the right one to ask.
- **content panes** — the file manager, the editor, the git view, the workflow
  pane.
- **a custom-command pane running something orrerix does not recognise.** If you
  typed your own command and it is not one of the CLIs above, orrerix has no
  basis for calling it an agent, so it is not listed. Its pane header still
  wears a lettered badge — a badge is a fallback, and being listed here is a
  claim.
- **a wrapped launch line**, for the same reason. Orrerix reads the *first*
  word of the command, so `bash -lc "claude"`, `npx claude` or a shim under
  another name names the wrapper, not the agent. The pane is not listed **and
  is not counted**, so with the panel closed the button will not light up for
  it. Launch it as the CLI itself, or — for a remote one — set the profile's
  agent.
- **an SSH pane whose profile names no far-end CLI.** The launch line describes
  the transport, not the agent. If you run an agent over that connection, set
  the profile's agent and the pane joins the list.
- **an SSH pane whose profile names a *shell*** — `bash`, `fish`, `pwsh` — or a
  name orrerix cannot read at all. Its pane header already says that is not an
  agent, and the list agrees with the header rather than contradicting it.

Being listed is decided once and used everywhere: the rows you see and the
number on the button are the same set of panes, never two answers.

## The states

| State | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| **needs you** | The pane is wedged and will not un-wedge itself — blocked, stranded on an unsubmitted prompt, or held on a dialog. |
| **question** | The agent is asking you something: a question or a gate. |
| **reported** | The agent has called in — its report is waiting on its orchestrator, not on you. The same word the pane header's chip uses. |
| **held** | Orrerix is withholding a delivery to this pane because its input box looks occupied. It clears itself. |
| **turn done** | The agent finished and is parked at its prompt. See the caveat below. |
| **working** | No evidence of a prompt. This is the default reading, and it is honest about being one — see below. |
| **idle** | For an orchestration pane, the roster holds no assignment for it; for any other pane, nobody has ever typed into it. Either way it is also quiet. |
| **dormant** | A restore placeholder. Nothing is running yet — click the pane to bring it back. |
| **exited** | The pane had a process and lost it. |

A pane carrying several of these at once is reported by the one that most wants
you: the list above is in precedence order, top first.

### "working" means *no evidence of a prompt*

Orrerix does not ask an agent whether it is busy — there is no such question to
ask, and inventing one would mean typing into a pane you are watching. `working`
is what is left when nothing else applies. A pane genuinely thinking and a pane
sitting at a prompt orrerix has not recognised both read `working`, and that is
the direction this deliberately fails in: it will under-claim a finished turn
before it will claim one that has not happened.

### "turn done" is a different confidence per CLI

`turn done` is the only state that makes a claim about the *agent* rather than
about the pane, so how far to trust it depends on which CLI is running.

| CLI | Trust |
| --- | --- |
| **Claude Code** | Trusted. Its idle input box is a shape orrerix measures directly. |
| **Copilot CLI** | Trusted after the first turn. Its boot-time terminal chatter is excluded from what counts as your input, and its permission prompt shows up as **question** rather than as a finished turn. |
| **OpenCode** | Trusted, with one unmeasured edge: whether its footer repaints are big enough to read as work has not been measured. If they are, the pane reads **working** — never a finished turn that has not happened. |
| **Anything else** | The generic prompt reading still runs; **working** is the default. |

Two more things worth knowing about it:

- **Clicking a parked pane does not un-park it.** Focusing a pane clears its
  attention chip, and reading that as "the agent resumed" would flip a finished
  turn back to `working` the instant you looked at it. The state clears on
  evidence instead: you typing, or the pane painting something substantial.
- **An orchestration agent being *idle* is not the same as it being at a
  prompt.** The roster's idle reading means "this agent holds no assignment",
  which is what feeds the **idle** state and nothing else.

## Filtering, and the count

The chips under the heading filter the list to one state, with a live count on
each. A chip is only offered for a state something is currently in — except the
one you have selected, which stays so you can always get back out of it.

The number on the **agents** button and on the tab is how many panes are in
**needs you** or **question**: the two states where a person has to do
something. It is visible with the panel closed, which is the point of counting
it. `held` is orrerix's own doing and clears itself; a **reported** pane is
waiting on its orchestrator, not on you; a finished turn is not blocking
anyone; and nothing is waiting on a dormant or exited pane.

## The spinner

The **working** row wears a small animated pixel-dot glyph — the same
character-cell style a terminal agent draws for itself. It is one inline SVG
sprite stepped by CSS, so it costs nothing per frame beyond what the compositor
does, and the row's state word carries the meaning on its own.

If your system asks for reduced motion, the glyph is drawn still. The word does
not change.

## What it does not do

- **No new probing.** Nothing here reads a terminal's screen on your behalf,
  starts a background poll of its own, or sends a keystroke to find out what a
  pane is doing.
- **No resize.** Opening and closing the panel resizes the panes exactly as it
  always did; switching between its two tabs, filtering, and changing the group
  order do not resize anything.
- **Agent panes only.** A plain terminal, a content pane, or a command orrerix
  does not recognise as an agent CLI is not listed and is not counted.
- **This window only.** A pane in another orrerix window, or an agent with no
  pane open, is not listed. The [session browser](session-browser.html) is where
  work you are not currently looking at lives.
