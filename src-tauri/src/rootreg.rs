//! The host half of the server-declared-root registry — who may **mint** a
//! declared root (#1042 slice B).
//!
//! The mechanism itself is [`loomux_engine::rootreg`] (slice A): a
//! `RootRegistry` of canonicalized paths, and a `DeclaredRoot` that only
//! `RootRegistry::resolve` can mint. Slice A shipped it consuming nothing. This
//! module is the other end — the *population* side — and it exists as its own
//! file rather than a corner of `fileedit.rs` because the whole security
//! argument of #1042 is a sentence about this file's contents: **these are all
//! the ways a root gets declared.** A reader who wants to audit that should be
//! able to read one screen, not grep a twenty-thousand-line module.
//!
//! # The trust rule, and where the teeth are
//!
//! A root is usable iff some trusted source declared it, and the trusted
//! sources are exactly two:
//!
//! 1. **The local trusted webview**, through [`admit_root`] below. It may admit
//!    anything, because it already owns the disk — a rule stopping it from
//!    declaring a root would buy nothing and would cost a folder chip that goes
//!    dead after an agent `cd`s, and a session restore that will not restore.
//! 2. **The engine's own derivations** — a group's checkout as orchestration
//!    creates or resumes the group, and a worktree the engine itself cut. These
//!    are values the engine computed, never a caller's string.
//!
//! The teeth are in what is *absent*: there is no third source, and in
//! particular no wire one. [`admit_root`] is classified **`disabled`** (§5.2 of
//! `docs/design/remote-engine-protocol.md`) — off the wire roster and advertised
//! as absent, exactly like `open_in_editor` and `fm_open` — so when the
//! listener's default-deny dispatcher lands, a remote peer can **use** declared
//! roots and can never **mint** one. That is the whole shape of the answer:
//! desktop UX survives by construction, and the enforcement is entirely
//! wire-side.
//!
//! If an authenticated remote admit path is ever wanted, it re-enters the roster
//! as `wire`/**owner** behind auth — a capability *added* later, which is
//! §1.1 H3's rule, and the opposite of one removed later.
//!
//! # What this slice does **not** do
//!
//! Nothing resolves yet. No command refuses a root it did not refuse before,
//! and `root-not-declared` is still returned to nobody. Boundary `resolve` on
//! the `ft_*`/`fm_*`/`git_*`/`gh_*` families — with the choke functions changing
//! signature so the compiler holds the property — is slice C. The ordering is
//! deliberate: **admits land before any refusal exists**, so the desktop keeps
//! working after every merge.
//!
//! One consequence of that ordering is worth naming rather than discovering in
//! slice C. [`admit_derived`]'s caller in `create_group_ex` registers a group
//! checkout that, on the create path, came from a caller argument. Until slice C
//! makes `create_orchestration` (and the rest of the orchestration `repo`
//! boundaries) resolve their `repo` against the registry first, that is a
//! laundering path on paper — a wire `create_group("C:/Users/me/.ssh")` would
//! mint a declared root.
//! It is inert today because no wire exists and nothing enforces, and slice C
//! closes it by the rule the design states in one line: **any command that would
//! cause a root to become registered from a caller argument must itself take an
//! already-declared root.**
//!
//! See `docs/design/groupid-and-path-roots.md`.
