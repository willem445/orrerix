// The icon registry and its role→dye table (#879, slice K).
//
// The human's ask was "really nice icons of different colours", and the design note turns
// that into something checkable: colour is the IDENTITY channel, an icon's hue says WHICH
// thing it is, and it may only reach a hue through a documented role mapping
// (docs/design/ui-redesign.md, §The three colour channels, maintainability rule 3). Prose
// like that survives exactly as long as the next person who edits the table, so the claims
// are measured here instead:
//
//   * the artwork carries no colour at all — recolouring the app must never touch an SVG;
//   * each of the eight identity hues is claimed by EXACTLY ONE role, so a colour on screen
//     resolves to one meaning rather than to whichever family happens to be amber;
//   * no role may name a `--state-*` token, which is the specific regression that would put
//     fleet legibility on the channel the brief measured as collapsing under colour-vision
//     deficiency;
//   * the stylesheet and the registry agree in BOTH directions — a role with no CSS rule
//     renders in plain ink and looks like a design decision nobody made;
//   * nothing is vendored that no surface renders, because an unused vendored glyph is a
//     licence obligation with no benefit;
//   * the provenance pin says the same commit in all three places that claim it.
//
// Run `npm test`.
