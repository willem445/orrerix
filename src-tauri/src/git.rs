/// Run a git-backed computation off the webview main thread (issues #399, #726).
/// Tauri dispatches a *synchronous* `#[tauri::command]` by calling it directly
/// on the main thread — the exact mechanism issue #207 already diagnosed for
/// the file-editor search command ("Tauri runs sync commands on the main
/// (webview) thread"). Every command here shells out to `git` and can block for
/// as long as a slow scan takes (a large working tree, a big history, a stalled
/// network share) or, for fetch/push/pull, an entire remote round trip — which
/// is unbounded. So each is a thin `async fn` wrapper that hands the real work
/// — still a plain, directly unit-testable `*_sync` function — to a
/// blocking-pool thread via `blocking::spawn_counted` (#1601 Phase 0.3 routed
/// every hand-off through that one counted door) and awaits it here instead.
///
/// #399 converted only the pane's open/refresh path; #726 finished the module,
/// and the `every_tauri_command_in_this_module_is_async_and_delegates` test
/// below pins that so a new command can't quietly land synchronous. Note the
/// test requires the delegation, not just the `async` keyword: Tauri polls a
/// command's future on the main thread, so an `async fn` that ran its spawn
/// inline before its first real await would freeze the GUI exactly as a sync
/// one does. Keep each wrapper a single `run_blocking(move || …_sync(…)).await`
/// — every argument check and every spawn belongs on the far side of it.
///
/// ## What going off-thread gives up
///
/// The freeze WAS an accidental mutual exclusion: while the main thread sat
/// inside a `git` spawn, no second invoke could start, so no two of these could
/// overlap. Off-thread they can. Unlike `gh.rs` (#724), that is not free here —
/// these commands mutate an index and a working tree, and two concurrent `git`
/// invocations against the same worktree contend on `index.lock`, where git
/// fails the loser rather than corrupting anything. Nothing is corrupted, but a
/// user who clicked *stage* then *commit* in quick succession used to get both
/// (the second invoke queued behind the first) and would now get an error
/// toast.
///
/// That exclusion is therefore restored deliberately, in the frontend, at the
/// one choke point every caller already goes through: the typed wrappers in
/// `src/git.ts` run every mutating command through a single FIFO queue
/// (`src/gitqueue.ts`), so their spawns stay serialized in click order exactly
/// as the main thread used to serialize them — while the GUI stays live,
/// because waiting in a promise queue blocks nothing. A sequencer op is one
/// queued job *including its unwind*: `run_sequencer` runs the command and its
/// `--abort` inside a single `_sync` body, so no other frontend git op can
/// interleave between a conflict and the abort that cleans up after it.
///
/// Reads are deliberately NOT queued: they were already async since #399, so
/// they could always overlap a write, and queueing them behind an unbounded
/// fetch would be a new stall rather than a restoration.
///
/// That overlap is *mostly* lock-free, and the exception is stated rather than
/// glossed. Measured per command, in the state that provokes git's
/// opportunistic index write-back — an entry that is stat-dirty but
/// content-identical — and pinned by
/// `only_git_status_is_protected_from_the_index_write`:
///
/// | read | takes `index.lock`? |
/// | --- | --- |
/// | `git_status` | no — `--no-optional-locks` suppresses it |
/// | `git_diff` (staged) | no — `--cached` never refreshes |
/// | `git_diff` (worktree) | **yes, and no flag prevents it** |
///
/// `git diff` rewrites the index with or without `--no-optional-locks`
/// (`builtin/diff.c` refreshes through a path that never consults the setting),
/// so that flag is deliberately not passed there: a no-op that reads like
/// protection is worse than none. The residual is that a refresh-driven
/// worktree diff can make a concurrent `stage`/`commit` fail to take the lock.
/// It is not new — an async read could overlap a main-thread write ever since
/// #399 — but #726 widens the window, because a read can now be *dispatched*
/// while a write is running, where before the busy main thread prevented that.
///
/// **Accepted, not fixed, and tracked as #754**, which carries the matrix above
/// and both mitigations weighed and rejected for this change: queueing the
/// worktree diff would stall the diff pane behind an unbounded fetch, trading a
/// rare error for a routine one, and retrying a lock-failed write in `run_git`
/// is a new mechanism of its own. The test above is the other half of that
/// decision — it fails the day any cell changes, so #754 is revisited on
/// evidence rather than left to rot.
///
/// What the queue does *not* claim. It covers commands issued through the
/// webview, not every writer in the process, and two others sit outside it:
/// the pane's own terminal (an agent running `git commit` in the very worktree
/// the view is showing), and loomux's own backend — `Registry::spawn_agent_ex`
/// calls `git_worktree_add_sync` directly from its own thread, never through a
/// command. Both bypassed the freeze in exactly the same way, so neither is
/// new; they are named so "the window is serialized" is never claimed. So
/// `index.lock` and a surfaced error were always the real arbiter.
///
/// And what it costs: a slow head job delays every later mutating op,
/// window-wide, across unrelated repos. That is the ordering the main thread
/// already imposed and strictly better than freezing for the same duration —
/// but a freeze is unmissable where a queue is silent, so the wait is bounded
/// (`QUEUE_WAIT_LIMIT_MS`) and rejects rather than running late, and the git
/// view announces a wait on the paths that have no button to spin.
