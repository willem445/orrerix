// Every embed view that can be WOKEN from outside registers a `hide` hook (#1318).
//
// THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR. `EmbedEntry.hide`'s own doc never carried a rule at all: it
// described the hook as "extra per-view cleanup beyond hiding its host" and closed with
// "Optional: most views need nothing beyond the generic hide". The rule existed, but as a
// comment on ONE view's registration three thousand lines below ("stops the follow poll on
// close/eviction ... which every POLLING view has to answer for", on the `timeline` entry
// since #648) — where nobody adding a NEW view has any reason to look, and scoped to a
// mechanism besides. Three views then proved both halves of that: the task board and the
// NEEDS-YOU panel are woken by Tauri event streams and registered no `hide` at all, so both
// refetched and rebuilt off screen on every agent write for the life of the session; the
// audit log DOES poll, and was missed anyway, because its `setInterval` is armed by a follow
// toggle rather than by `show()`. The rule now sits on the interface — *if something outside
// a view can make it do work, `hide` is where it says what happens when nobody is looking* —
// and is enforced here rather than asserted in a doc a third time.
//
// WHY A MANIFEST AND NOT A PURE SCAN, and what each half is allowed to decide. The
// manifest DECLARES which kinds are woken, with the reason in the row; the scan is the
// thing that stops a declaration going stale. The scan may only ever ADD to the woken set,
// never subtract from it: a view that gains a `listen()` or a `setInterval` while declared
// quiet fails, and a view declared woken by an INDIRECT waker the scan structurally cannot
// see keeps that declaration. `FileEditView` is exactly that case — its `ft-search`
// subscription is made through `fileapi.ts`'s `onSearchBatch` wrapper, so no `listen(`
// appears in its own source — and it is why the scan is not the authority here.
//
// STATED BLIND SPOTS. The scan reads each view's own file only, so it is blind to every
// waker that lives somewhere else, and two of the eight are exactly that: `FileEditView`'s
// `ft-search` subscription goes through `fileapi.ts`'s `onSearchBatch`, and `GitView` is
// woken from `pane.ts` itself (`Pane.onExternalGitChange` and every shell prompt call
// `notifyPrompt`). Both carry `indirectWaker` and are declared woken by hand. A scan over
// `pane.ts` for calls into a view could catch the second class, but only by allow-listing
// the method names that are PULLS rather than wakes (`groupView.minChromeHeight`), and this
// repo's convention is that a guard deciding from a name enforces nothing a rename cannot
// step over — so that residue is carried by the manifest and by review, deliberately, and
// the `why` on each row is where the reading was done. A listener registered under a
// dynamic event name is invisible to it too. It also reads `pane.ts` textually — an
// `embedRegistry.set` call assembled any way other than a literal object at a literal kind
// is not something it can name, so it refuses to pass over one instead, by requiring the
// set of parsed entries to be exactly `EMBED_KINDS`.
