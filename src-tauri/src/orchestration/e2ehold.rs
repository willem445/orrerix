//! Test-only injector for a long registry-lock hold — the mechanism the E2E
//! soak/liveness lane (#1603, plan #1600 §3 Phase 4.1) has to reproduce in
//! order to assert anything about it.
//!
//! ## Why this exists at all
//!
//! Plan #1600 §2.2 is the finding this module answers: every guard in this
//! repo is a *shape* scan, and every one of the beta4/5/6 hangs is a
//! *liveness* bug. A shape scan cannot ask "does the app still accept input
//! after running for a while under load", and the honest reason it never got
//! asked is that nothing in the tree can make the app hold a lock for a long
//! time on purpose. The soak lane's first four assertions need no help; the
//! fifth — *a long hold is in progress and the app still answers* — needs the
//! hold to exist.
//!
//! ## Why it cannot ship enabled
//!
//! Two independent gates, one of them a compile-time one:
//!
//! 1. **`#[cfg(debug_assertions)]`.** The watcher below is compiled only into
//!    a dev-profile build. `Cargo.toml`'s `[profile.release]` does not set
//!    `debug-assertions`, so a release build keeps cargo's default (`false`)
//!    and the only `start` it contains is the empty arm at the bottom of this
//!    file. There is no flag, no environment variable and no file that can
//!    reach the removed code, because it is not in the binary.
//!    `tests/e2ehold_guard.rs` pins that shape.
//! 2. **An explicit opt-in.** Even in a dev build the watcher thread is not
//!    started unless `ORRERIX_E2E_LOCK_HOLD` (or the legacy
//!    `LOOMUX_E2E_LOCK_HOLD`) is exactly `1`. `npm run tauri dev` therefore
//!    behaves as it always has.
//!
//! ## Why a file, not a `#[tauri::command]`
//!
//! `docs/design/e2e-testing.md` states the harness's own goal as "zero new
//! Tauri commands or ACL surface", and the queue-badge spec turned down a
//! test hook for the same reason. A command would have been permanent
//! product surface: a name in `generate_handler!`, an entry in
//! `command_manifest::APP_COMMANDS`, and an ACL grant in
//! `permissions/sets/` — all of them present in a *release* build even with
//! the body cfg'd away. A file under the app-data root costs none of that,
//! and it is strictly better for the test besides: the Playwright process
//! *owns* that directory (`e2e/fixtures.ts` creates it and points
//! `ORRERIX_DATA_DIR` at it), so it can trigger a hold and read back when the
//! lock was actually acquired without going through the very IPC path whose
//! liveness is the thing under test. A probe that has to be answered by the
//! app to tell you the app is stuck is not a probe.
//!
//! ## Protocol
//!
//! - The test writes `<data root>/e2e-lock-hold.request`:
//!   `{"target":"groups","hold_ms":<milliseconds>}`. The value is the
//!   spec's own budget knob, not a constant of this protocol.
//! - The watcher consumes (deletes) it, acquires that registry mutex, and
//!   writes `<data root>/e2e-lock-hold.state` with `acquired_ms` set, then
//!   sleeps, then rewrites it with `released_ms` set.
//! - The test reads the state file directly off disk. `acquired_ms` present
//!   is the positive control that the hold really happened; `released_ms`
//!   still absent when the liveness assertions finish is the control that the
//!   hold spanned them, rather than having expired before they ran.
