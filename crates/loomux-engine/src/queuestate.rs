//! The delivery subsystem's two mutable maps, behind doors that cannot be
//! opened without paying what opening them costs (#562, #497).
//!
//! **Why this module exists at all, given the maps used to be two plain
//! fields on `OrchRegistry`.** Rust's privacy is per-MODULE, and
//! `orchestration/mod.rs` is one 31k-line module: a field declared private
//! there is still reachable from every line of it, so "the only way to
//! mutate `queues` is through the sanctioned path" was not a claim the
//! compiler could check — it was a claim `docs/design/orchestration.md`'s
//! #470/#523 mutation-site table made on the compiler's behalf, and that
//! table was wrong in both possible directions on the same day (stale for
//! #533's two new mutators, and mis-transcribed for a row its own grep DID
//! return). Moving the two maps into a module of their own is what turns
//! the rule into something `rustc` rejects rather than something a reader
//! has to notice. The *file boundary* is the mechanism; everything below is
//! just the API it makes unavoidable.
//!
//! Two invariants live here, one per map:
//!
//! - **`QueueMap` (#562) — "every mutation of `queues` rewrites the
//!   snapshot" (#468).** `&mut` access is available only inside
//!   [`QueueMap::mutate`], which takes the snapshot writer as an argument
//!   and runs it, with the lock released, as soon as the mutation returns.
//!   A caller cannot mutate and forget to persist, because there is no
//!   expressible order of operations in which the persist does not follow.
//!   The mutation states which of the two it did — [`QueueDirty::snapshot`]
//!   or [`QueueDirty::nothing_persisted`] — and that is a *typed value it
//!   must produce*, not a call it can omit.
//!
//! - **`DrainerRegistry` (#497) — "every removal from `queue_draining` is
//!   generation-checked" (#470 B1 round 2).** The map exposes exactly one
//!   removal, [`DrainerRegistry::release`], and it takes the generation.
//!   An ungenerationed removal is not a thing a future call site can write
//!   incorrectly; it is a thing it cannot write.
//!
//! **What this does NOT claim.** A type can only reject the constructions
//! it can name. `QueueDirty::nothing_persisted` is a claim the mutation
//! makes about itself ("nothing the snapshot carries changed"), and a wrong
//! one is still wrong — what changed is that it is now an explicit,
//! greppable, reviewable assertion at the mutation site instead of the
//! silent absence of a call. That is the whole delta, and it is the one
//! that mattered for #533's two sites: both would have had to state a false
//! claim in the diff rather than say nothing at all.
