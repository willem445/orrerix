// The shared model catalog (#935 slice B) — the one answer to "which models may
// this CLI be pinned to?", consumed by the launcher's per-role selector and (next
// slice) the workflow pane's block editor.
//
// What these defend is not "the merge concatenates two arrays" but the ways a
// merged suggestion list silently costs a human the model they chose:
//
//   1. A ROLE DEFAULT THAT SURVIVES THE MERGE. `pickerSelection` falls to its
//      `custom…` branch for a value outside the list, so a merge that dropped a
//      curated default would open the form on a hand-typed id — looking exactly
//      like a human's own choice (`orchclis.test.ts` names the same failure for
//      the curated list alone).
//   2. THE INHERIT ROW STAYING FINDABLE, AND STAYING SELECTED. `INHERIT_MODEL` is
//      the empty id: the "send no --model at all" row that is the honest default
//      on opencode (#722). It is both the row a long probed list would bury and
//      the value a falsiness check would mistake for "nothing chosen" — and
//      either mistake ends with loomux pinning a model over the one the human
//      configured.
//   3. NO CURATED FALLBACK FOR A CLI WITH NO ROW. The block editor's CLI list is
//      wider than the launcher's (`gemini` is a WORKFLOW_CLIS member with no
//      ORCH_CLIS row), so a catalog that fell back to the first row would offer
//      claude's aliases as gemini models.
//   4. IDS VERBATIM. opencode's are `provider_id/model_id` and the `/` is part of
//      the id (#722) — a merge that normalized one would produce a model that
//      does not exist.

//
// A second seam beside the probe, and the tests below defend the reason it is
// separate rather than folded in.
//
// **The credit-safety property, stated the way it actually holds now.** Under
// #993 `detect` SPAWNED the CLI, so the restraint was that nothing ran unasked
// and a second gesture did not become a second spawn. #1002 reversed that by
// the human's own direction and #1020 implemented it, so both halves of the old
// sentence are now false and the truth is:
//
//   - `detect` cannot spawn ANYTHING. It is a lookup against a memo the backend
//     filled (`src-tauri/src/modelwire.rs`), and a paint may call it precisely
//     because there is no longer any code behind it that could start a process.
//   - Something DOES run unasked, deliberately: the backend's startup sweep,
//     which is now the only thing in loomux that runs `list_cli_models`, once
//     per CLI per app run, and the only place a control request is spawned.
//
// So the properties worth pinning here are no longer about refusing to spend.
// They are about the BOUND that replaced the click — one lookup per CLI per app
// run, because the callers are paints now and nothing else limits them — about
// the push route that corrects a form which looked too early, and about the
// answer never being allowed to narrow what the human can already pick.
//
// If you are auditing constraint-3 compliance, the spawn you are looking for is
// in `modelwire.rs`'s `start_startup_sweep`, not here. `docs/design/model-catalog.md`
// §Credit safety carries the decision and what remains unverified about it.
