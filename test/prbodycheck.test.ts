// `test/prbodycheck.test.ts` — the receipt checker's own pins (#2168 S1).
//
// WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR. `scripts/pr-body-check.cjs` re-measures the figures in a posted
// PR body against the head that body claims to describe. Its whole value is that it goes
// red on the twelve figures the #2168 classification found blocking a review round, and
// stays silent on the ten merged bodies those rounds ended in. So the suite is built as a
// pair, and BOTH halves are load-bearing:
//
//   `body-good.md`   — every receipt correct. This is the NEGATIVE CONTROL. A checker that
//                      refuses everything passes every positive assertion below and fails
//                      here, which is the only thing that makes the positives mean
//                      anything.
//   `body-stale.md`  — the same body with each figure left at the value it had one round
//                      ago (the collateral-of-a-fix class, 7 of the 23 fail rounds).
//   `body-misc.md`   — the non-numeric half: an identifier that names nothing, a
//                      placeholder nobody filled, a unit stated as chars for a byte
//                      figure, a run bound to the wrong SHA, a cite past end of file.
//
// `facts.json` is everything `git` and `gh` would have said. Nothing here runs either, so
// the suite is offline and deterministic — and the fixture's numbers are all DISTINCT
// (#1182): the four instruments of one file are four different values, which is what makes
// the instrument-naming assertions fail-able rather than decorative.
//
// Every assertion that a body produces NO finding of some kind carries a positive control
// beside it, because "no finding" is also what a checker that never ran produces.
