// #432 item 2: pane.ts's doFit() defers the actual geometry change (fit.fit()
// + the resize decision, in doResize()) behind `term.write("", () =>
// this.doResize())` instead of calling fit.fit() directly. The reasoning:
// fit.fit() resizes xterm's buffer SYNCHRONOUSLY, but term.write() is parsed
// ASYNCHRONOUSLY (xterm's own internal WriteBuffer, chunked so a huge paste
// doesn't block the main thread) -- so a resize that ran the instant a
// debounced fit tick fired could land while output the PTY already sent
// (under the OLD geometry) was still sitting unparsed in that queue, and get
// interpreted under the NEW one once it finally got processed.
//
// pane.ts itself can't be unit-tested here (it's DOM/Tauri-IPC-bound --
// CLAUDE.md's DOM-free-pure-module convention, mirroring test/xterm-
// reflow.test.ts's own split for the same reason). What CAN be pinned
// DOM-free, with @xterm/headless, is the actual invariant the fix leans on:
// that term.write()'s own callbacks fire in the SAME order the writes were
// queued in, so an empty write queued after a real one is guaranteed to run
// its callback only once that real write has been fully parsed into the
// buffer -- regardless of how long xterm's internal chunking takes. If
// xterm.js ever stopped guaranteeing that (e.g. reordered callbacks for an
// empty write as a fast-path optimization), this fix would silently stop
// working, and this test would catch it.

// Long enough that xterm's WriteBuffer has to chunk it across more than one
// internal batch rather than finishing inline within the write() call --
// the exact "already-queued, not-yet-parsed" state a resize must never race.
