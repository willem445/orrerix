// Pure per-tab agent/orchestration counting (#194). DOM-free so the tab-bar
// counter — which the demo found unreliable (it sometimes rendered, sometimes
// not, with a stray "+0") — is deterministic and unit-tested (test/tabcounts.test.ts).
// The tab bar (tabbar.ts) feeds this the tab's live pane classification (from
// the grid) plus whether the tab owns an orchestration group; it renders what
// comes back and never counts from a flaky backend poll again.
//
// THE BUG this replaces: the counter was driven ONLY by a 4-second backend poll
// of a tab's bound group (groupSummary.live_agents) — so a tab with plain agent
// panes and no group showed nothing, a group not yet known to the backend showed
// nothing (the poll's try/catch skipped it), and a just-opened tab flashed 0.
// Counting the panes actually open in the tab is exact and immediate.
