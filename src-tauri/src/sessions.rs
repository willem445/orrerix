// A **curated item list** (#988), never `pub use loomux_engine::sessions::{self}`:
// a module self-export would hand every future engine item an
// `crate::sessions::…` path nobody chose, and — the reason it matters here —
// this lift force-widened eleven items to `pub` on the engine side, five of
// which were bare module-private before. What each caller may spell is decided
// here instead, by copying each item's OLD visibility keyword onto its
// re-export:
//
//   * `pub use`         — was `pub` in this file (unchanged reach).
//   * `pub(crate) use`  — was `pub(crate)` in this file.
//   * bare `use`        — was module-private in this file; only this module can
//                         name it, exactly as before.
//
// What a re-export CANNOT narrow is the item itself: every one of these is
// `pub` in `loomux-engine` now, so `loomux_engine::sessions::…` reaches it from
// any sibling crate in this workspace. That is forced (an item must be `pub`
// there to cross the boundary at all) and harmless (`publish = false` — see
// that crate's manifest); it is stated rather than papered over, per
// `loomux-engine/src/model.rs`'s standing correction.

// Reach unchanged: these were already `pub` here. `set_pi_sessions_root_for_test`
// (#2126 P2) joins them for the same reason its three siblings are here — a
// `tests/*.rs` integration test cannot reach a `#[cfg(test)]` hook, and the pi
// scan tests must never read the developer's own `~/.pi`.

// carries every flag baked into that command forward by construction, so
// the *next* per-CLI launch semantic added there survives for free. The
// actual anti-pattern, and the one #456's investigation actually named, is
// `scan_claude`/`scan_copilot` RECONSTRUCTING a resume command from the CLI
// VENDOR'S OWN session files — which cannot know what loomux originally
// launched with, because that information never lived there. This module is
// loomux's own record of launch intent, captured at the one moment that
// information exists (launch time), so the scanners can re-derive it
// instead of guessing from a foreign source.
//
// Before this generalization, `scan_claude` carried NO record at all: every
// Sessions-tab resume of a claude session emitted a bare `claude --resume
// <id>`, unconditionally — not "one flag lost" like the copilot case #456
// diagnosed, but every flag, always. That was never identified as its own
// bug before this file's #457 pass.
//
// Keyed two ways, chosen per CLI by what loomux actually knows at launch:
//
//   - `IntentKey::Session` — claude solo panes always mint a session id
//     before launch (`launcher.ts`), so the record can key on it exactly.
//     A session id is unique by construction (no code path mints the same
//     id for two different launches), so a `Session`-keyed entry can NEVER
//     become `Conflicted` — see `record_claude_launch_posture_impl`, and
//     `session_keyed_entries_are_never_conflicted` for the pin. This makes
//     claude strictly better off than copilot here, and retires — for the
//     claude case only — the eviction-ambiguity residual #460 documented as
//     a follow-up for this issue.
//   - `IntentKey::Cwd` — copilot solo panes never get an id at launch (it
//     mints its own, invisibly, and `spawn_session_watcher` in
//     orchestration/mod.rs learns one after the fact only for GROUP
//     agents), so this reuses #460's original cwd-keyed, conflict-tracked
//     machinery verbatim, just moved under this wider key type. Precise
//     per-session keying for copilot solo is still tracked as further
//     follow-up, not attempted here — it needs the same class of watcher
//     machinery #460 already deferred.
//
// THE RULE THIS MODULE ENFORCES (#460, now binding on BOTH key shapes): on a
// permission decision, ambiguity resolves to the smaller grant, never the
// larger one — and that includes under STORE PRESSURE (review B1) and
// across FILESYSTEM CASE SENSITIVITY (review B2) for the cwd-keyed half, not
// just in the ordinary lookup. Because a `Cwd` key is only a cwd, TWO
// copilot sessions launched in the same folder at different times can
// disagree (toggle on, then later off, or vice versa) — cwd alone can't
// tell which record belongs to which session being restored. Ideally this
// would resolve by matching each record against the resumed session's own
// start time, but copilot's `workspace.yaml` documents no reliable creation
// timestamp we can act on (undocumented internal format — see the module
// doc's docs-not-inference rule) and the file's OS birth time is not a safe
// proxy (copilot may rewrite it turn-to-turn, resetting it). So: a cwd with
// only ONE posture ever recorded resolves to that posture; a cwd where BOTH
// true and false have been recorded is CONFLICTED and resolves to `None`
// (no flags) — losing autopilot on restore is a shift+tab away, but silently
// granting `--allow-all-paths` to a session the user deliberately launched
// without it is not something they could ever notice or undo. A claude
// session with NO recorded intent (foreign, pre-upgrade with no migrated
// record, or evicted) resolves the same way, to `None` — flags only where
// there is a recorded intent saying so, never by inference, never by
// default. This is a genuine behavior WIDENING versus before this PR (a
// claude Sessions-tab restore previously carried no flags ever; now it can,
// where — and only where — loomux itself recorded that it should).
//
// Conflict is derived and stored AT WRITE TIME, as one sticky enum value per
// key (`Posture::Conflicted`) — never re-derived at read time from a list of
// raw records. This is what makes the guarantee survive eviction (review
// B1, caught with a runnable counter-test against the original flat
// per-write log: capping-and-evicting individual records could drop the
// OFF half of a conflict and leave a lone ON record, silently flipping a
// permanently-ambiguous cwd back to granting autopilot). With one entry per
// key, the cap counts ENTRIES (of either key shape, one shared pool) and
// evicts the least-recently-TOUCHED one whole — "touched" meaning written OR
// re-confirmed, so an actively-used folder/session is never the eviction
// target — and eviction can only ever move a key from {True | False |
// Conflicted} to NO RECORD, which resolves to `None` right alongside every
// other "nothing to go on" case. There is no path from eviction to a larger
// grant than the key already had.
//
// SOFT MIGRATION (#457): this store's file was `copilot-posture.json`
// (copilot-only, cwd-only) before this PR. `load_launch_intent` below reads
// that file, read-only, EXACTLY ONCE — only when the new file has never
// been written on this machine — and folds its entries in as `Cwd`-keyed
// copilot records. A cold reset (ignore the old file, start empty) would be
// safe by the same "no record → no flags" rule above, but it would also
// silently re-inflict the exact annoyance #456 was filed to fix ("I have to
// toggle autopilot manually, per folder") on the very release that fixes
// it — a bad trade for a few lines of migration code, so this reads the old
// file instead of resetting.
//
// Migration does NOT re-derive the platform key (`posture_key`/
// `posture_key_for`) — it copies each legacy entry's `cwd` field VERBATIM
// into the new store (see `load_launch_intent`'s match arm below). This is
// deliberate, not an oversight: `cfg!(windows)` is a COMPILE-TIME constant
// baked into one built binary, so a single loomux install's write-time
// keying and read-time keying (migration or ordinary lookup, doesn't
// matter) are always performed by the SAME code in the SAME process —
// there is no runtime path where they could disagree on which arm to use.
// The only way a legacy key and a lookup could apply DIFFERENT arms is the
// underlying file traveling between a case-folding (Windows) and a
// case-sensitive (macOS/Linux) install — and `data_root()` resolves to
// `dirs::data_dir()`, an OS-NATIVE per-machine path (`%APPDATA%` vs.
// `~/Library/Application Support` vs. XDG) that does not coincide across
// platforms by default; getting two different-OS installs to share this
// file at all requires deliberately pointing `LOOMUX_DATA_DIR` at a synced
// location on both. That scoping property is #460's, unchanged by this PR:
// the original single-arm-per-store design never supported cross-platform
// key portability, migration or not, and a verbatim-copy migration can't
// make that any better OR any worse than it already was — it only has to
// preserve whatever a same-binary write already produced, which it does by
// construction. Pinned (not just asserted) by
// `soft_migration_preserves_the_legacy_cwd_key_exactly_regardless_of_which_
// platform_wrote_it`, mutation-verified against re-normalizing a second
// time (see that test's own doc comment for why a same-host test alone
// can't catch that mutation).

///
/// The cost this replaces (issue #342, measured in #493): a machine with a long
/// orchestration history accumulates thousands of `.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl`
/// files across every past project, and the pre-#493 scan opened and head-read
/// EVERY one of them on EVERY scan — 826 files in 13–17s on the machine #493
/// was reported from, for a list that has always shown at most 300 rows.
///
/// Two bounds, in this order:
///
///  1. **Metadata first.** Candidates are collected from directory enumeration
///     alone, sorted by mtime, and cut to `LIST_LIMIT` BEFORE anything is
///     parsed. The rows a growing history adds now cost one `stat` each, not a
///     head-parse — so the scan stops degrading monotonically with history,
///     which was #493's third question.
///  2. **A persisted index.** Each survivor's head-parse is cached in
///     `session-index.json`, keyed by path and validated by `(mtime, len)`, so
///     an unchanged file is never opened again on a later launch. A steady-state
///     launch parses only what actually changed since the last one.
///
/// The row set is unchanged: same "newest 300 by mtime" the pre-#493 scan
/// returned, in the same order (same comparator over the same enumeration
/// order), because sorting on metadata sorts on the identical `modified_ms` the
/// rows carried before.
///
/// A breadcrumb records the timing and the parsed/reused split, so a
/// slow-startup report still has an actual number to point at (and so a
/// regression that quietly stops using the index is visible in the log).
