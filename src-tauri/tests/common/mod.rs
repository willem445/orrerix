//! Shared fixtures for the backend integration tests.
//!
//! Included with `mod common;` — this is `tests/common/mod.rs`, so cargo does
//! NOT build it as a test target of its own (only `tests/*.rs` are), and
//! CLAUDE.md constraint 4 is untouched: everything here compiles INTO the
//! including integration test, which is still where anything linking the lib
//! has to live.
//!
//! # Why this file exists (#1702)
//!
//! The defect #1702 fixes was invisible to every test in this repo for four
//! betas, and the reason is a FIXTURE SHAPE rather than a missing assertion.
//! `attention_tick` deadlocks only when an agent is simultaneously (a) running,
//! (b) bound to a pty, (c) present in the `by_pty` reverse index and (d) quiet
//! past the attention window. `attention_setup` in `orchestration/attention.rs` — the
//! helper every attention test uses — spawns agents with NO pty, so `pty_id` is
//! `None`, the per-agent mask is never reached at all, and the whole class is
//! unreachable from the suite. The soak lane has the same gap from the other
//! end: it wedges a lock deliberately and probes, so it measures what happens
//! to a VICTIM of a hold and never builds a holder out of ordinary state.
//!
//! So the generator below fabricates the shape the field has and the suite did
//! not: several agents, each pty-bound AND `by_pty`-mapped AND session-bound,
//! each carrying a session's worth of delivered prompts, each with a large
//! rendered tail. It is a generator rather than one test's inline setup because
//! #1702's siblings and the soak lane want the same subject.
