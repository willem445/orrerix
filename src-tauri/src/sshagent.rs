//! Load a passphrase-protected SSH key into the user's **own** ssh-agent, once,
//! so an SSH pane connects without a prompt the human has to answer per pane
//! (#2368 slice A).
//!
//! ## What this module does and does not hold
//!
//! orrerix holds no credentials (`docs/design/ssh-panes.md`, "No credentials, and
//! what makes that structural"), and this module does not change that rule — it
//! extends it to a passphrase. The passphrase arrives as one command argument,
//! is written to one `ssh-add` process, and is gone: nothing here persists it,
//! `sshprofiles.json`'s schema is untouched, and its encode/decode allowlists
//! still drop a `passphrase` key at both ends. What ends up holding the
//! *decrypted key* is OpenSSH's own agent, exactly as after a hand-run
//! `ssh-add` — which is the point: the key material never enters orrerix at all.
//!
//! **Residual, stated rather than claimed away.** The passphrase reaches this
//! process as a `String` in Tauri's IPC deserialization, and the webview holds
//! it in an `<input>` buffer before that. Neither copy is under this module's
//! control, so neither is zeroed; `zero_secret` below overwrites only the buffer
//! this module owns. That is a real residual and the honest bound on the claim:
//! orrerix does not *store* the passphrase, and does not pretend to have scrubbed
//! every transient copy of it out of two runtimes it does not own.
//!
//! ## Why a hidden ConPTY rather than askpass, stdin or `-t`
//!
//! Every other way of handing `ssh-add` a passphrase depends on which OpenSSH
//! build is installed. On Windows, `readpass.c` invokes askpass **only** when
//! `SSH_ASKPASS` is set, `SSH_ASKPASS_REQUIRE=force` postdates the Windows 10
//! in-box 8.1p1 client, and Win32-OpenSSH #2115 reports `SSH_ASKPASS` being
//! ignored outright on 8.6p1 — so askpass is version roulette on the baseline.
//! `read_passphrase` is called with `RP_ALLOW_STDIN`, but on a **non-tty** stdin
//! that routes back to askpass, so a pipe is not a way in either. `-t` (lifetime)
//! is ignored by the Windows agent (Win32-OpenSSH #1056).
//!
//! Giving `ssh-add` a real console and answering its prompt is what a human does,
//! and it works on 8.1p1 and 8.6p1 alike. That console is the same
//! `native_pty_system().openpty` call `pty::spawn_pty_blocking` makes — no new
//! mechanism, no new dependency — and it is opened **hidden**: it is never
//! registered with `PtyManager`, never streamed to the frontend, and dropped
//! when this function returns.
//!
//! ## Why the passphrase can never reach a pane
//!
//! It is not passed to anything that builds one. `PaneSetupInput`, `SshPlan`,
//! `PaneOptions`, `PersistedPane` and the spawned argv are all unchanged by this
//! slice; the launcher reads the field into a local, calls this command, and
//! drops it. The passphrase is *unrepresentable* on the pane path rather than
//! merely absent from it.

///
/// **It is a bound because the code enforces it, not because someone added up
/// the paths.** The first version of this constant was arithmetic over an
/// enumerated path list, and it was wrong: `run_ssh_add`'s agent check does not
/// return on success, it FALLS THROUGH to the conversation, so
/// probe + start + probe + drive was a real fourth-step path nobody had summed —
/// 35 s against a constant claiming 20, with a test that pinned the two
/// compositions someone had listed and therefore *certified* the false number
/// (#2397 review B1; `CLAUDE.md`'s "a guard's green is evidence about its
/// POPULATION" in its most literal form).
///
/// So the shape changed rather than the number. Everything before the
/// conversation now shares ONE deadline ([`AGENT_SETUP_BUDGET`], enforced by
/// [`ensure_agent`]), and the conversation gets its own full
/// [`SSH_ADD_TIMEOUT`] whatever the setup spent. There is no longer a set of
/// paths to enumerate — every path is setup-then-conversation — which is what
/// makes this total true by construction rather than by a list that the next
/// person to add a step will forget to update.
///
/// The third term is [`CHILD_REAP_BUDGET`], and it is here for the same reason
/// one level down: the conversation ends by KILLING a child, and until #2397
/// review B1 it then waited for that child unbounded. “Enforced” has to survive
/// the last statement, not just the loop — so the reap is bounded too, and its
/// budget is part of this sum rather than a step outside it.
///
/// The fourth term is [`SETUP_STEP_OVERRUN`], and it is the same omission one
/// layer out: each setup step is a `capture_raw_with_timeout`, whose own
/// post-kill reap runs AFTER the `timeout` it was handed and is therefore
/// outside [`AGENT_SETUP_BUDGET`]. The shared budget bounds when a step may
/// **start**; it cannot bound what a step spends past its own deadline. So the
/// setup phase really ends at its budget plus an overrun, and this constant said
/// 27 s against a path that could take 33 — three setup steps, three overruns
/// (#2594 item 2).
///
/// One overrun and not one per step, because [`run_setup_steps`] re-reads the
/// shared deadline BETWEEN steps and stops once it has passed: a step is only
/// ever started while time remains, so at most one step can be in flight when
