//! The backend half of #743's enforcement — **E1** in `docs/design/performance.md`.
//!
//! THE INVARIANTS. Two of the six in that note are properties of the command
//! surface as a *set*, which no test of any single module can see:
//!
//!   INV-1 (§3) — every `#[tauri::command]` either delegates its whole body to
//!   a blocking pool (§2 P1), or is sync and enumerated below with an argued
//!   class. Tauri polls an `async` command's future on the webview thread, so
//!   `async fn` alone moves nothing (§1, the #724 review finding) — the
//!   delegation is the property.
//!
//!   INV-2 (§3) — no process spawn and no network round trip on the webview
//!   thread, ever. No class permits one: a `cheap` body additionally must carry
//!   no `Command::new` / `ShellExecuteW` / `.output(` / `fs::` marker, and only
//!   a `debt` row may name one, each pointing at its conversion issue.
//!
//! `test/perfpolicy.test.ts` (E2) is the same mechanism on the frontend's
//! listener and timer surface — scan plus a test-side manifest — and the two
//! are meant to read as one idea.
//!
//! WHY A MANIFEST AND NOT A LINT. The property is not "no blocking sync
//! commands exist": 0 do today (66 when this file landed, 1 until #1592
//! converted the last one), enumerated in
//! #743's census (planning comments parts 1-2, which `performance.md` §5 names
//! as the one source of truth) and owned by the issues in `DEBT_OWNERS`. An
//! EMPTY debt tier is the manifest working, not the manifest expiring: the
//! forwards half of the equality is what refuses the next unargued sync
//! command, and it bites exactly as hard against zero rows as against one.
//! Nor does an empty tier mean every owning issue is finished — #749's scope
//! was "an index or a live-groups filter, not just a thread hop", and #1592
//! delivered the thread hop and the audit-slurp half; `performance.md` §5
//! keeps the remainder. The property is that **one cannot be
//! added silently**. A new sync command fails this test until somebody writes
//! down what it does on the webview thread and who owns moving it off, and that
//! sentence is a review-visible diff. The debt tier is the census made
//! executable: deleting a row is the roadmap, adding one has to argue itself.
//!
//! THE BOUND OF THE CLAIM, stated rather than implied. **A source scan cannot
//! follow call chains.** A sync command whose *helper* spawns is not caught
//! mechanically, and the shipped tree still has one:
//! `orch_confirm_solo_copilot_autopilot`'s one-line body hands work to a raw
//! thread it never names. Two more were live examples until their conversions
//! took them out of the sync tier — `orch_open_ref` (#762, a scan-invisible
//! pair of `git` spawns) and `fm_open`/`fm_open_with` (#746, a one-line body
//! over a blocking `ShellExecuteW` in `filemgr.rs`'s helper). Both were found
//! by reading rather than by failing, which is the residue this paragraph is
//! about, and neither being here any more is why it names them anyway: the
//! bound did not narrow, the tier did. This is the same
//! bound `gh.rs`'s in-module enumeration test (the seed this generalizes)
//! already accepts. The scan pins the shape — which commands are sync, and that
//! each one's cost is written down — and the manifest reason plus review carry
//! the residue. For the same reason the `cheap` marker check is belt-and-braces
//! on top of the review, not a substitute for it.
//!
//! Nor can a scan see "nothing before the first await": it requires the
//! delegation call to be *in* the command's own body, which is what makes an
//! inline-work regression (#724's mutation recipe) fail, but a body that did
//! real work *and then* delegated would still pass. Review owns that half.
//!
//! WHAT MAKES THE WALK EXHAUSTIVE. The discovered command-name set must
//! **equal** `command_manifest::APP_COMMANDS`, in both directions. A file the
//! walk never opened, an attribute marker that stopped matching, a command
//! registered but not found, or one found but not registered — each fails
//! loudly rather than letting the per-command assertions pass over an empty
//! set. The sync half is pinned the same way: `SYNC_COMMANDS` must equal the
//! discovered sync set, so a conversion that lands without deleting its row is
//! as red as a new sync command that lands without adding one.

///
/// **Why this reads the FRONTEND.** `SYNC_COMMANDS` can say what a command
/// costs but not how often it is called, and that fact lives in `groupview.ts`
/// and `tabbar.ts`. Which is precisely how those five passed two rounds of
/// classification (#752's conversions and #743's census) as correctly `cheap`
/// and still froze the app. Making the poll SITE an input is what stops the
