//! Leaf-lock and request-sized-read pins for the orchestration poll paths
//! (#743 S7) — the enforcement `docs/design/performance.md` INV-5 says a source
//! scan cannot give it, because no scan can see lock *scope*.
//!
//! Must be an integration test, not a unit test (CLAUDE.md constraint 4 — the
//! Windows test exe needs build.rs's comctl32-v6 manifest). Everything here
//! drives the SHIPPED functions against a real `PtyManager` backed by a real
//! ConPTY pair and a real (trivial, immediately-exiting) child, with no Tauri
//! `AppHandle` (unavailable headless) and no real agent CLI (constraint 3).
//!
//! The technique is `ptywrite.rs`'s, inverted onto the read side: a pane whose
//! output ring is HELD by the test makes every `output_tail` of that pane park
//! *inside* the read — deterministically, with no sleep and no race against how
//! fast a 256 KiB clone happens to run on the host. The question each lock test
//! then asks is the one the invariant is actually about: **while one pane's
//! ring is being read, does everything else still move?**
//!
//! Reverting either lock fix (holding the `agents` guard across the pty reads
//! again) reds the two `does_not_hold_the_agents_lock` tests by timeout, which
//! is the shape the defect has. Reverting the statusline bound (a whole-ring
//! `output_tail` instead of `output_tail_bounded`) reds the bounded-read test
//! on the value it produces.
