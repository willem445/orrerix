// SSH connection profiles (#887, slice S1) — the pure schema layer for
// `sshprofiles.json`, a sibling of tabs.json/settings.json in the loomux AppData
// root (src-tauri/src/uistate.rs owns the atomic write + corrupt-quarantine, and
// never parses this schema: the blob is opaque to it, exactly as tabs.json and
// settings.json are). Reached through the typed loadSshProfiles/saveSshProfiles
// wrappers in pty.ts (CLAUDE.md constraint 5). DOM-free and unit-tested
// (test/sshprofile.test.ts) like tabstore.ts/settings.ts.
//
// A profile is the *declaration* of an SSH target: where to connect and how the
// remote end should be addressed. It is not a session, not a credential store,
// and not an argv — building the actual ssh command line is sshcommand.ts's job
// (slice S2), which takes flat parameters rather than this type so the two
// modules stay independent.
//
// ## THE INVARIANT: no secrets, ever
//
// loomux holds no SSH credentials. Authentication is deferred entirely to the
// user's own ssh setup — ssh_config, ssh-agent, and interactive prompts, which
// simply render in the pane because the pane IS a terminal. This mirrors gh.rs's
// posture (loomux stores no GitHub token; it shells out to the user's
// authenticated gh) and it is why `sshprofiles.json` is a plain, hand-readable,
// unencrypted file: it is safe to be one, and it must stay safe to be one.
//
// Two structural guards keep that true rather than merely stated:
//
//  1. **Encode and decode are both allowlists.** `normalizeSshProfile` reads only the
//     fields declared in `SshProfile`; `profileToWire` writes only those fields.
//     A password, passphrase or private key hand-added to the file (or attached
//     to a profile object by some future caller) is dropped on the way in and
//     never written on the way out — it cannot survive one load/save cycle.
//  2. **`identityFile` is a PATH and is checked to be one.** It is the one field
//     through which key *material* could enter by the front door — paste a PEM
//     blob into a field labelled "identity file" and a naive store would write
//     the private key straight into the JSON. A value carrying a newline or a
//     PEM armour header is therefore refused (the field degrades to null, and
//     the profile survives without `-i`): storing key material is the failure
//     this whole design exists to prevent, so this fails closed.
//
// The schema is a PUBLIC CONTRACT — a file on the user's disk that older and
// newer builds both read. Its full write-up (fields, forward-compat, the
// argument above) lands in docs/design/ssh-panes.md with the rest of the feature
// (slice S5).

  /** Create or update one connection and publish the whole file.

   *  **Writes serialize.** Each one waits for the previous to have LANDED before
   *  it publishes, because two overlapping writes each publish a whole blob and
   *  the backend applies them in completion order, not call order — so a blob
   *  computed first but landing second silently drops whatever the other one
   *  added. That is the same lost-update this class exists to prevent, one level
   *  up: the read-before-publish rule stops a save built from a list nobody
   *  read, and this stops a save built from a list that was correct when it was
   *  computed and stale by the time it landed.
   *
   *  Serialized HERE rather than left to the caller (#1358 review N2). Today the
   *  only caller is `persistSshProfile`, behind `SubmitLatch` — `submit` takes
   *  `latch.begin()` before any await, so a second concurrent submit cannot
   *  start and the interleaving is unreachable. But this class's whole argument
   *  is that an ordering nobody enforces is not an ordering, and a doc-comment
   *  asking the next caller to be single-flight is exactly that. The invariant
   *  is cheaper to keep than to document.
   *
   *  `BoardPrefsStore` (`boardprefs.ts`), the precedent this class is modelled
   *  on, does NOT serialize. That divergence is deliberate and is *not* a claim
   *  about whether its own caller is safe — it is a different feature's module
   *  and widening this diff into it would make the review worse. Flagged, not
   *  changed.
   *
   *  Keeps position on an edit and appends on a create — a picker that reorders
   *  itself under the human every time they launch is its own small bug. */
