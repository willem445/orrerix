// Pure decision for the overlay-toggle button/keybinding shared by every
// embeddable view (#361 user-demo finding): while a view is DOCKED, that
// toggle is deliberately disabled rather than fixed to correctly close/reopen
// it. See docs/design/embedded-panels.md's "Overlay toggle vs. dock" section
// for why: the toggle and the dock slot are two independently-driven pieces
// of visibility state for the same view (the toggle flips the view's own
// `hidden` flag; the slot flips its host panel's), and proving every one of
// their many entry points (header buttons, keybindings, a view's own Escape
// handler and internal close button, main.ts's command dispatch) keeps them
// in lockstep is a standing tax future changes can silently violate. Docking
// removes the toggle from the equation entirely instead: a docked view is
// always shown, the only way to make it stop sharing space with the terminal
// is the explicit "Un-embed" menu action, and the toggle works normally again
// once it does.

 *  whatever process runs in the pane — so the stream itself is resolve-only and
 *  never declares. What may declare is a HUMAN asking for a view *at* that cwd,
 *  which is an open. A `close` is a dismissal and a `noop` is a docked view
 *  refusing the toggle outright; neither is anybody asking for anything, and
 *  treating them as declarations would let an agent that has `cd`'d somewhere
 *  interesting get that directory permanently declared the moment the human
 *  dismissed a panel — the opposite of the rule.
 *
 *  Fail-closed on the kind, too: a view added later declares nothing until it is
 *  added to `CWD_DECLARING_VIEWS` on purpose. `kind` is a plain `string` rather
 *  than `pane.ts`'s `EmbedKind` so this module stays free of the pane; the call
 *  site passes the narrower type and `pane.ts` pins the relationship. */
