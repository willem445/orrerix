//! Pure core of the notification backend (#243): the condition an agent can
//! register, the poll outcome, the notice text, and the cap/expiry
//! constants. No `gh`, no locks, no registry state — everything here is a
//! plain function over plain data, so it is unit-testable with canned `gh
//! --json` fixtures and no subprocess. See `OrchRegistry`'s `notify_*`
//! methods (`src-tauri`'s `orchestration/mod.rs` — the impure half, i.e. the
//! poll thread and the registry state, which has not moved into this crate) and
//! `docs/design/orchestration.md`'s "Notification backend" section for the
//! design rationale — in particular why this is a fixed set of structured
//! conditions and not a caller-supplied poll command.
//!
//! Three MCP tools sit on top of this (`mcp.rs`): `notify_when`,
//! `list_notifications`, `cancel_notification`. All three are **self-
//! addressed** — there is no `agent_id` parameter, and a notice can only
//! ever land in the registering agent's own pane via the existing
//! `deliver_prompt(..., Delivery::MidSession)` path.

///   notice says so explicitly — that divergence *is* the fact the reader
///   needs, and it is louder than anything the frozen note can say.
/// - The note is labelled `Note (registered)` rather than `Your note`, so
///   nothing in it reads as current.
///
/// This function never rewrites or reinterprets the note — it is the agent's
/// own words, echoed verbatim (modulo sanitizing), and only its *as-of* is
