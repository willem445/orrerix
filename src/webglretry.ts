// Pure, DOM-free core of the WebGL re-acquire policy (#720). DOM wiring is
// panelifecycle.ts's `tryWebgl` / `handleWebglLoss`.
//
// The failure this exists to end
// ------------------------------
// `WebglAddon.onContextLoss` fires and pane.ts disposes the addon, which drops
// that terminal back to xterm's DOM renderer — the correct immediate response,
// and where it used to stop. Nothing ever retried, so a single lost context
// left ONE pane in a grid of six several times more expensive to render than
// its neighbours, permanently and invisibly, until the human happened to hide
// and re-show the project tab (`Pane.setHidden`, which drops and re-acquires
// the context for unrelated reasons). A pane that is quietly the expensive one
// for the rest of a session is exactly the kind of cost nobody attributes.
//
// Why a retry needs a bound at all
// --------------------------------
// A WebGL context is a capped resource: the browser holds a fixed number live
// and evicts the oldest when a new one is created past the cap (the same cap
// that makes `setHidden` drop contexts for inactive tabs at all — see
// panelifecycle.ts's `setHidden` and docs/design/project-tabs.md). So "lost context" and
// "someone else created a context" are the SAME event seen from two panes, and
// an unbounded retry turns that into a live-lock: pane A re-acquires, evicting
// pane B, whose retry evicts pane A, forever, each round burning a context
// creation and a full texture-atlas rebuild. The ladder below is what makes
// that sequence terminate.
//
// Two things damp it before this policy is even consulted, and they set the
// scale of the delays. `WebglRenderer` does not report a loss immediately: it
// preventDefaults `webglcontextlost` and waits 3000 ms for a
// `webglcontextrestored` that the browser may deliver on its own, firing
// `onContextLoss` only if none arrives (node_modules/@xterm/addon-webgl/src/
// WebglRenderer.ts). So by the time this policy runs, the browser's OWN
// restoration path has already been given its chance and declined — which is
// why the first rung is seconds, not milliseconds: there is nothing to be won
// by racing back in.

/** Backoff ladder, in order, for successive losses in one streak. Three rungs
 *  spanning ~72 s: a transient loss (a driver reset, a burst of context
 *  creation while a tab switch re-acquires several panes at once) is over well
