// `docs/orchestration.md`'s bounded claims about the `driver:` block, pinned to
// `src/workflow-schema.json` (#1872).
//
// The class this exists for: a `docs/` page is prose, nothing links it to the code it
// describes, and the drift is silent in BOTH directions. #1870's two blocking findings
// were both false sentences on this page that a fully green `npm test` +
// `cargo test --workspace` had no way to see — one of them said the driver's three
// timeouts are *refused* out of range when the engine *clamps* them and refuses the
// three counters instead. This file makes that sentence, and every number beside it,
// fail when either surface moves: the page assigns each policy its family by naming
// that family's FIELDS, and site 3 below checks that membership against the manifest.
// Until #1951 B2 the page named its families by a bare noun instead ("the three
// counters", "the three timeouts"), which the manifest has no counterpart for and
// nothing here could pin — swapping the two nouns reproduced #1870 B1's sentence
// verbatim with this file green.
//
// WHAT IS PINNED. Three sites on the page, all against `sections.driver` in the
// manifest, all default-deny in both directions (an unmatched row or an unmatched
// schema field fails — a rename on either side cannot step over the join):
//
//   1. The bounds TABLE anchored by the `<!-- pinned-to-schema: ... -->` marker in
//      "The review driver's `driver:` block": per field, min, max, default, and
//      refuse-vs-clamp.
//   2. The YAML example directly above that marker: every value it shows for a
//      *ranged* field is that field's own default, which is what the paragraph under
//      it claims.
//   3. The "Review driver" row of the bounds summary further up the page: its two
//      clauses, and per clause the refuse/clamp polarity, the range tokens, and the
//      set of manifest fields the clause names — which is what makes the policy
//      ASSIGNMENT checkable rather than only the numbers beside it.
//
// WHAT IS NOT PINNED — stated structurally, because the honest residual is a shape and
// not a list of sentences someone remembered to check:
//
//   * Any bound stated on this page OUTSIDE those three sites. The test locates its
//     subjects by marker and by the summary row's own lead-in; a fourth statement of
//     the same numbers, in a paragraph anywhere else on the page, is invisible to it.
//     That is the rule a docs editor has to keep: a new bounded claim about `driver:`
//     goes in the table, not in fresh prose.
//   * Every OTHER row of that same bounds summary. Site 3 below reads the one row whose
//     subject is `driver:`; its siblings state bounds for other blocks and are pinned by
//     nothing. Concretely: editing the "Lock resources" row's `slots` from 1–64 to
//     1–128 reddens no test, here or in `test/workflowschema.test.ts` (the pre-existing
//     manifest-vs-pane pins never read this page). Each is a slice of the same shape.
//   * Every `help:` string in the manifest. The docs prose paraphrases those rather
//     than quoting them, so nothing here compares them.
//   * Any file other than `docs/orchestration.md`. `docs/design/review-driver.md`
//     restates these numbers in two places and NEITHER is pinned: §5.3's example shows
//     the seven defaults, and §2.3 ("Three consequences that are decisions, not
//     defaults") states the counters' ranges as `1..=3` and `0..=1` because its whole
//     subject is why those are refused rather than clamped. §5.3's per-field range
//     comments were removed so that file carries the ranges once rather than twice, but
//     "removed from the example" is not "purged from the file" (#1951 B1). The marker
//     mechanism is page-agnostic and a second page can adopt it; this file declares one
//     page and checks that one.
//   * The round-trip promise about ticking the driver on and off (#1949, the
//     "For one flip on an existing block" paragraph). That is a claim about a
//     BEHAVIOUR, not a bound; it has no counterpart in the manifest and no mechanical
//     link to the tests that do cover the toggle. This file does not reach it.
//   * Whether the MANIFEST agrees with the ENGINE. That is the other half of the
//     contract and it is pinned on the Rust side
//     (`the_workflow_schema_manifest_matches_the_engines_raw_types`). A manifest that
//     had drifted from `parse_workflow` would satisfy every assertion below, because
//     every assertion below reads the manifest as the statement of record.
