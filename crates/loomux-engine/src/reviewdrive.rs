//! The engine-driven review-loop driver: the pure core (#1778 S1).
//!
//! Design note: `doc/design/review-driver.md`. That note is the spec, and this
//! module is the half of it that has no I/O in it at all — the state machine
//! (§2.1), the persisted shape (§5.2), the counters (§2.3) and the decision
//! `rd_driver_tick` makes once its facts are in hand (§2.4). The tick itself,
//! the `gh` reads behind those facts, the spawns, the notices and the audit
//! lines are S3's, in `src-tauri`; the MCP tools (§5.1) are S4's; the `driver:`
//! block (§5.3) is S2's, in `workflow.rs`.
//!
//! **Why the split is drawn here and not somewhere more convenient.** Every
//! decision this feature makes is a function of facts orrerix read a moment
//! earlier — the PR's head, its checks, a verdict file, a clock. Putting the
//! decision in the same function as the reads makes it testable only through a
//! fake `gh`, which is how a state machine ends up pinned by its plumbing. So
//! [`decide`] takes the facts as an argument, reads no clock, spawns no child
//! and touches no file, and the whole of §2.1's table is exercised by building
//! a [`DriveFacts`] and asserting a [`DriveStep`].
//!
//! # What this module is NOT
//!
//! It is not a second reader of the merge gate. §4 of the note is explicit that
//! a third implementation of the gate decision is a defect rather than an
//! optimization, so the gate's answer, the routed lane list and each lane's
//! verdict arrive here as **facts the existing parsers produced** —
//! [`ReviewVerdict`] itself is what a [`LaneFact`] carries, and the staleness
//! questions are asked with that type's own [`ReviewVerdict::reviewed`] and
//! [`ReviewVerdict::body_changed`] rather than with a comparison written here.
//!
//! # Where this module knowingly goes beyond the note
//!
//! Three persisted fields exist that §5.2's example entry does not show, and
//! they are called out here rather than left for a reader to notice as drift.
//! §2.2 bounds two waits — `held(lane-stalled)` is "no verdict inside
//! `lane_timeout_minutes`", `held(fix-stalled)` was "neither pushed nor reported
//! inside `fix_timeout_minutes`" until #2168 E1 gave it a second site with its own
//! anchor — and the shape in §5.2 carries no timestamp
//! from which either could be measured, while §2.4 resumes a drive from disk
//! across a restart, so an in-memory clock cannot carry them either. A bound
//! with no anchor is not a bound. So:
//!
//! - [`LaneRecord::spawned_ms`] — when this lane's delegate was last spawned or
//!   resumed. The `lane-stalled` anchor.
//! - [`LaneRecord::briefed_head`] and [`LaneRecord::briefed_digest`] — the
//!   revision that lane was last briefed at, as **one key**, the same
//!   `(head, digest)` the gate binds a verdict to. §2.1 re-briefs a lane whose
//!   `pass` went stale, and without this the driver cannot tell a lane already
//!   re-opened at the live revision (wait for it) from one that still needs
//!   re-opening (brief it) — it would re-brief every tick. The head alone is
//!   not the key; [`lane_open_for`] carries why, and the defect it names is one
//!   this slice actually shipped and CI caught.
//! - [`DriveEntry::fix_handback_ms`] — when the drive last entered `fix-wait`.
//!   The `fix-stalled` anchor **in `fix-wait`**; the hand-back is the moment
//!   that wait began. #2168 E1 gives that hold a second site, in `ci-wait`,
//!   whose wait began at the PUSH rather than at the hand-back and so is
//!   measured from `state_since_ms` — see [`decide_fix_receipts`].
//! - [`DriveEntry::fix_kickback_ms`] — when the drive last answered a worker's
//!   `report(progress)` in that worker's own pane (#1959). Not a timeout
//!   anchor: it is compared against `fix_handback_ms`, which makes the budget
//!   one answer per hand-back and renews it with no reset to remember.
//! - [`DriveEntry::fix_pushed_ms`] — when the worker last pushed onto a head
//!   this drive handed back for; `None` unless `ci-wait` was entered by arc 7
//!   (#2168 E1). The `fix-stalled` anchor in THAT state, and the one clock here
//!   that a non-arc also writes: `note_fix_push` re-stamps it when a further
//!   push lands mid-wait, which is exactly what `state_since_ms` cannot do,
//!   since `transition` refuses a `ci-wait` -> `ci-wait` self-arc and so leaves
//!   the state clock on the FIRST push.
//!
//! `drive-stalled` needs none of these: it is the drive's **age**,
//! `now - started_ms`, so it keeps §5.2's own `started_ms`.
//!
//! **§2.2 used to forbid a general "when did the state last change" stamp, and
//! #2110 adds exactly that field on purpose** —
//! [`DriveEntry::state_since_ms`], written on every arc. The ban was never
//! about the stamp; it was about a drive whose ONLY bound is one, and its
//! worked example is §8's `also: [base-green]` row: that drive advances
//! `gate-check` → `ci-wait` on every wake, resets any per-state clock forever,
//! and would sit on a red default branch in silence. So the age is kept, as the
//! backstop that cycler falls through to, and the per-state clocks are added
//! above it. Both, not either.
//!
//! What forced the addition is the other half of the same question. Two drives
//! were parked `drive-stalled` at four hours, and neither was stalled: one was
//! mid-round with CI green at a new head, the other had spent three of those
//! hours unable to spawn a lane at all because another drive held every slot.
//! An age cannot tell those from paralysis, because every drive's age grows at
//! the same rate whatever it is doing — and the reason the *first* clock in
//! this struct was an age is that a bound with no anchor is not a bound, not
//! that an age was the right measure. See [`state_bound_ms`], and
//! [`DriveEntry::starved_total_ms`] for the time both clocks now exclude.
//!
//! - [`DriveEntry::state_since_ms`] — the `state-stalled` anchor.
//! - [`DriveEntry::starved_total_ms`], [`DriveEntry::starved_state_ms`] — what
//!   the drive spent unable to spawn, which neither clock charges it for.
//! - [`DriveEntry::held_from`], [`DriveEntry::held_after_ms`] — what the drive
//!   was doing when a bound fired, so a resume is a decision rather than a
//!   reflex.
//!
//! # One seam here is not a contract
//!
//! [`decide`] and the fact types it consumes are a **slice author's seam**, not
//! a §-backed public contract: the note specifies the states, the arcs, the
//! counters and the file, and says nothing about how the tick's decision is
//! factored out of its reads. Do not go looking for the section — there isn't
//! one. What that means for a later change is that this shape may be reworked
//! on its own merits, where [`DriveState`], [`transition`] and
//! [`ReviewDrivesState`] may not: those three are the note's, and changing one
//! changes `doc/design/review-driver.md` first.

/// Where one driven PR is (§2.1). **Four working states, one parked state, two
/// terminals** — seven, and the enum is closed.
///
/// **There is no `Unknown` variant and no catch-all arm**, exactly as
/// [`crate::mergeq::EntryState`] has none, and §2.1 makes that a prescription
/// rather than a style note. The reason is that §5.2 persists this as a
/// *string* while promising unknown *fields* are tolerated and preserved, and
/// the two promises pull opposite ways unless one governs. The refusal governs:
/// an unknown field is data some newer build added that this one can carry
/// across a read/write cycle without understanding, and preserving it loses
/// nothing; an unknown state is the entry's entire meaning, and every available
/// default is a guess that either resumes a drive somebody stopped or abandons
/// one still running. So a file naming a state this build does not know fails
/// to parse — §2.4's `rd-state-unreadable`, refuse the tick, back off, never
/// repair and never delete.
///
/// **`Held` is parked, not terminal, and the distinction is load-bearing.** The
/// queue's `KickedBack` *is* terminal, and a kicked-back PR comes back through
/// a fresh `queue_merge` as a NEW entry. A drive cannot copy that, because §2.3
/// carries the spent counters across a resume and a fresh entry would reset
/// them — the one thing INVARIANT 9's "yours count too" forbids. So `Held`
/// keeps its counters, has exactly two outgoing arcs (`drive_review` resumes
/// it, `cancel_review_drive` cancels it), and is never pruned (§5.2).

///
/// **Enumerated, and a pair this does not name is a refusal**, copying
/// [`crate::mergeq::transition`], which matches explicit pairs and falls
/// through to `Err`. §2.1 gives the reason: a state machine whose §8 needs an
/// arc §2 never named does not fail as a documentation gap, it fails at
/// runtime, on the degradation path, where nothing is watching.
///
/// Thirteen arc *rows* are twenty legal `(from, to)` pairs, because three rows
/// are written over a set of froms — arc 3 (`-> fix-wait` on a conflict) over
/// `ci-wait` and `gate-check`, arc 12 (`-> held`) over the four working
/// and gate states, arc 13 (`-> cancelled`) over all five non-terminals. All
/// are spelled here as explicit variant lists rather than as a predicate like
/// `!from.is_terminal()`: the two spellings coincide today, and the enumerated
/// one is what makes an eighth state a compile-time decision instead of
/// something a predicate quietly absorbs.
///
/// **Arc 1 is not here.** `(none) -> ci-wait` is a *creation* — `drive_review`
/// on a PR with no live entry (§5.1) — and it has no `from`. It is
/// [`DriveEntry::new`], the way the queue's own arc-from-nothing is
/// `QueueEntry::new`.
///
/// **Nor is a per-reason restriction on arc 12,** and that is a decision rather
/// than an omission. §2.1's per-state "Leaves for" column names which
/// [`HeldReason`]s each state reaches, but it omits `messaged` from every cell
/// while §2.2 and arc 12 require it from any working state (§7: a driven
/// delegate can call `message_orchestrator` at any point in the loop). Read as
/// a second, finer table it would therefore refuse a hold the note mandates. So
/// the arc list governs — §2.1 says it is "a table of its own", listed in full
/// precisely so nothing is inferred from the prose — and the "Leaves for"
/// column is read as the summary it is. [`decide`] is where each reason is
/// actually produced, and it produces them per state.

///
/// **The clamp only ever tightens, and it is a capability boundary rather than
/// input hygiene.** §2.3: a repo may run a *tighter* loop than the orchestrator
/// template promises; it may not run a looser one, because the driver acts on
/// the orchestrator's authority and a repo file that raised the bound would be

/// `driver.max_review_rounds: 9` that reached a decision would be a repo file
/// granting a capability, not a validation slip.
///
/// **Two independent layers hold it, and neither is allowed to rely on the

/// [`decide`] clamps again on the values it actually reads. The second is not

///
/// **That seal does not make an out-of-range value unspellable, and claiming it
/// did was weaker as well as false.** The bounds fields are `pub` — they are

/// clamps unconditionally — no `if`, no caller opt-out — and *shadows* its own
/// binding with the clamped value, so every read below that line is of a

// Forward compatibility here is the merge queue's, and the OPPOSITE of
// `.orrerix/workflow.yml`'s — §5.2 flags the asymmetry itself, because the two
// persisted surfaces this design adds take opposite postures and a reader will
// otherwise infer one from the other: **policy fails loud, state degrades
// gracefully.** `workflow.yml` is human-authored policy, so a key this build
// does not understand means a human believes a policy is in force that is not.
// `review_drives.json` is machine-authored state, and an older build must be
// able to read it and rewrite it without destroying what a newer one wrote.
//
// "Tolerated" is not enough on its own: serde ignores unknown fields by
// default, and an ignored field is *lost* on the next write. So every type here
// carries a flattened `extra` map, which makes the round trip **preserving**
// rather than merely non-fatal — the property
// `review_drives_round_trip_preserves_unknown_fields` pins.
//
// The one thing that is NOT tolerated is an unknown **state** string, and
// [`DriveState`] carries that argument.

//
// **Why these exist at all, and what they replaced.** Until #2110 the only
// clock over a working drive was its total age, and the two measured failures
// were the two that measure cannot tell apart: a drive making steady progress
// across four hours of transitions was parked as "stalled", and a drive that
// spent three of its four hours unable to spawn a lane at all had that
// starvation counted against its own budget. An age answers "how long has this
// drive existed"; nobody wanted that bounded. What a bound is *for* is "how
// long has this drive sat in one place", and that is what these measure.
//
// **They are constants and not `driver:` policy**, on [`CAP_HOLD_MS`]'s
// argument: how long orrerix waits on its OWN machinery — a check run, a
// reviewer lane, a resumed worker — before telling an orchestrator is not a
// repo's call.
//
// **How each combines with the repo's knobs differs per arm, and there is no
// one sentence for all four.** This block used to carry one — "a per-state
// bound is the LARGER of its constant and whatever the repo configured" — and
// it was the fifth surface of a claim rounds 3 and 4 had already corrected
// elsewhere. It was true of one arm, never true of two, and stopped being true
// of the fourth when #2117's W3 made that arm an add. [`state_bound_ms`] is
// where the per-arm rule is argued; the short form:
//
// - `gate-check` has **no knob at all** — [`DriveLimits`] carries no `gate_`
//   timeout — so there is nothing to combine with and nothing to shadow.
// - `fix-wait` is the LARGER of its constant and `fix_timeout_minutes`. It is
//   the only arm that is a max at all.
// - `review-wait` is its constant PLUS `lane_timeout_minutes` per required
//   lane, because that state holds several waits in sequence and the product
//   alone funds their silences and none of the gaps between them.
// - `ci-wait` is its constant PLUS `fix_timeout_minutes` (#2168 E1), on the
//   same argument: since E1 that state holds the check matrix and then the
//   worker's report on a pushed head, one after the other. It was a bare
//   constant before E1 and belonged on the `gate-check` line.

///
/// **What each state's bound is made of, per state** — there is no single rule,
/// and an earlier version of this paragraph claimed one ("`max` of the constant
/// and the state's own configured bound"). That was true of every arm when it
/// was written, stopped being true of `review-wait` the moment #2117's W3 made
/// that arm an ADD and of `ci-wait` when #2168 E1 made that one an ADD too, and
/// was never true of the arm that has no knob to take a max against. Three
/// shapes over four arms:
///
/// - `gate-check` is a **bare constant**. [`DriveLimits`] has no `gate_`
///   timeout, so there is nothing to shadow and nothing to take a maximum
///   with.
/// - `fix-wait` is `max(constant, fix_timeout_minutes)` — a floor over the
///   knob, so a repo that raises `fix_timeout_minutes` to four hours raises
///   this with it rather than being parked at ninety minutes by a number in
///   loomux.
/// - `ci-wait` is the constant **PLUS** `fix_timeout_minutes` since #2168 E1,
///   on `review-wait`'s argument rather than `fix-wait`'s, and the choice of
///   ADD over `max` is the whole of the point. That state now holds two waits
///   in SEQUENCE — the check matrix, and then the worker's read-and-report on
///   the head it pushed ([`decide_fix_receipts`]) — so a bound that is merely
///   the LARGER of the two funds only one of them. Under `max`, a repo with
///   `fix_timeout_minutes` above the constant gets a state bound EQUAL to the
///   knob, and [`decide`] reads the state bound above the state's own logic:
///   the first tick past it answers `state-stalled` and the `fix-stalled` that
///   names the pane to read never fires at all. That is the preemption
///   [`HeldReason::StateStalled`] says cannot happen, and it is the same
///   zero-margin defect #2117 review 2 found in `review-wait`, one state over.
///   Added, the constant is the slack over the second wait exactly as it is
///   there.
///
///   **The add applies to every `ci-wait` drive, including one that never
///   handed anything back**, and that is chosen rather than overlooked. A bound
///   scoped to the waiting drives would have to read [`DriveEntry::fix_pushed_ms`],
///   and `rdtick` computes `held_bound_ms` off the entry AFTER the arc into
///   `held` — the arc that clears that flag — so the notice would quote a
///   different bound from the one that fired. What a first drive pays is that a
///   check run which never resolves is caught at 150 minutes rather than 90 on
///   stock knobs. It fails toward a later park and never toward an earlier
///   false one, every wait-specific hold still fires inside it, and the
///   twelve-hour backstop is unmoved.
/// - `review-wait` is the constant **PLUS** `lane_timeout_minutes * lanes`, for
///   the reason argued below. It is the arm that is not a max, and the sentence
///   above exists because saying "max" of all four read as covering it.
///
/// # `review-wait`'s floor is the sum of the SILENCES, plus slack
///
/// `required_lanes` is how many lanes the gate requires at this head, and the
/// gate's lanes are reviewed in SEQUENCE — `first_stale_lane` picks one at a
/// time and a lane brief is not an arc, so nothing re-stamps
/// [`DriveEntry::state_since_ms`] between them. So a legitimate `review-wait`
/// can hold `required_lanes` full `lane_timeout_minutes` waits end to end, and
/// the floor has to cover their sum or the bound fires on a drive whose every
/// reviewer answered in time.
///
/// **That product alone is not enough, and the gap is what review 2 on #2117
/// found.** `lane_timeout_minutes` bounds a lane's SILENCE, measured from that
/// lane's own `spawned_ms`; this bound measures ELAPSED time in the state, from
/// `state_since_ms`. Every interval inside `review-wait` that is not one
/// lane's silence is unfunded by the product: the stretch from entering the
/// state to the first brief, and the tick-detection gap after each verdict
/// lands. With three lanes at the sixty-minute default, three reviewers each
/// answering at fifty-nine minutes and three such intervals costing ninety
/// seconds apiece crosses a bare 180-minute floor — and the margin is exactly
/// zero wherever `lane_timeout_minutes * required_lanes` reaches
/// [`REVIEW_WAIT_BOUND_MS`], which is precisely the configuration the floor
/// exists to protect. A drive whose reviewers all answered promptly would park
/// `state-stalled` naming no lane, which is the same class of false park
/// #2110 exists to remove.
///
/// So the slack is [`REVIEW_WAIT_BOUND_MS`] itself, ADDED to the product rather
/// than compared against it. It is not a tuned allowance-per-lane: an
/// allowance sized to the detection gap would be a guess about tick timing that
/// goes stale with `RD_BACKOFF_MS`, while a whole extra copy of the constant is
/// a bound whose looseness is stated rather than estimated. The cost of being
/// generous here is small and one-directional — this is the catch-all, and
/// every wait-specific hold (`lane-stalled`, `cap-full`) still fires inside it.
///
/// **The residual is that the sum can exceed the twelve-hour backstop**, and
/// then the backstop fires first because [`decide`] checks the age above the
/// state bound: `lane_timeout_minutes: 240` on a three-lane gate floors this at
/// 900 minutes, so such a drive parks `drive-stalled`. **On STOCK knobs the
/// crossover is nine lanes** — `180 + 60n >= 720` from `n = 9` — which is the
/// number an operator declaring a wide gate wants and which the worked example
/// above does not give; pinned by
/// `the_review_wait_floor_overtakes_the_backstop_at_nine_lanes_on_stock_knobs`.
/// That is degraded but not
/// the pre-#2110 notice — `held_from` is stamped on every hold arc, so the
/// `drive-stalled` notice still names the state and the time in it. Pinned by
/// `a_review_wait_floor_that_outruns_the_backstop_still_names_the_state`.
///
/// Zero required lanes (a routing answer this tick could not produce) falls
/// back to the constant plus its slack; that drive holds
/// `routing-unaccountable` on the same tick anyway.
///
/// # What these clocks charge that nobody wants them to
///
/// Two properties are disclosed rather than closed, both inherited from
/// [`DriveEntry::state_elapsed_ms`] being wall time minus cap starvation and
/// nothing else (#2117 review 3):
///
/// - **orrerix's own downtime is charged to the state.** The clocks are
///   absolute stamps, not tick counts, so a group paused or an app closed for
///   two hours while a drive sat in `ci-wait` parks it `state-stalled` on the
///   first tick after the restart. The age bound had this property before
///   #2110 and nobody hit it at four hours; these bounds are tighter, so it is
///   now reachable in an ordinary lunch break. It is not silent (the notice
///   names the state and the elapsed figure) and it is recoverable by the
///   remedy that notice prints — arc 11 re-stamps every clock. Closing it wants
///   a `last_tick_ms` and a gap-detection rule, which is a second clock with
///   its own failure mode (a drive that never ticks would never bound), and
///   that is a decision this issue did not ask for. Pinned by
///   `orrerix_downtime_is_charged_to_the_state_it_spanned`.
/// - **The `review-wait` bound moves when the GATE does**, because
///   `required_lanes` is read fresh from `facts` on every tick rather than
///   stamped when the state was entered (#2117 review 6, premortem 1). A
///   workflow edit or a path-scoped routing rule that takes a three-lane gate
///   down to one shrinks this bound from six hours to four **retroactively**,
///   so a drive five hours into a legitimate three-lane sequence parks on the
///   next tick for time it spent inside the wider bound it was actually
///   running under. Reading the count fresh is what makes the bound track the
///   gate at all, and stamping it at state entry would freeze a six-hour
///   bound onto a drive whose gate had since narrowed — the opposite error,
///   and the one that fails toward NOT parking. Disclosed rather than
///   chosen between: every test here holds `required_lanes` constant, so
///   nothing pins bound stability against a moving lane list.
/// - **A backward wall-clock step suspends every bound** rather than firing
///   one: the subtraction saturates, so `state_elapsed_ms` reads zero until the
///   clock catches up. That is the fail-safe direction — no false park — and it
///   is the same behaviour `age_ms` has had since #1778. Pinned by
///   `a_clock_that_steps_backward_suspends_the_bound_rather_than_firing_it`.

///    §8: `cancelled`, and only on a positive answer. A PR that is gone has no
///    hold worth reporting, and `cancelled` says more than `drive-stalled`.

///    `also: [base-green]` row parks a drive on a red default branch by cycling

    //
    // - `gate-check` read only `facts.gate`, so a base that moved while the

    //   unmergeable — #2942, where `rev-final` passed carrying
    //   `mergeable:CONFLICTING` in its own summary and the cost (a hand rebase,
    //   a re-drive at `rounds_already_spent 3`, two fresh whole-diff lanes, ten
    //   minutes of cap starvation, three orchestrator turns) was paid outside
    //   the driver.
    // - `review-wait` asks `route_reviewers` FIRST, and routing needs the
    //   changed-file list, which GitHub does not compute for a conflicted head.
    //   So the same conflict parked the drive `held(routing-unaccountable)` —
    //   a hold whose notice says *which reviewers are required is unknown* for
    //   a PR whose real problem is that it does not merge, and whose remedy
    //   (`drive_review` again) reproduces it. Measured on #3118.
    //
    // Above the routing check for exactly that reason: routing being
    // unaccountable is a CONSEQUENCE of the conflict there, not an independent
    // fact, and the honest report is the one naming the cause. It stays BELOW
    // the bounds and the `messaged` hold above — those are about the drive
    // rather than the PR, and a drive already past its clock is not made young
    // by a rebase — and below the empty-head guard, which is "we could not read
    // this PR at all".

    // `rebase_attempts` on the conflict the worker was just asked to fix would
    // park `rebase-limit` before the worker had a chance to push.
    //
    // `Pending`/`Unknown` are NOT conflicts: §8's posture is that an unknown is

/// [`first_stale_lane`] re-reads the `(head, digest)` key every tick and a
/// `pass` recorded at d1 does not stand at d2. #1875's measurement is that
/// every code PR of that session paid at least one such round, and #1870 is the
/// fully instrumented one: `pass` at digest `bbff76b8`, 0 findings, the CI
/// section filled, `BODY CHANGED SINCE PASS`, gate blocked, re-record — with
/// the head never having moved and not one line of code having changed.
///
/// The digest rule itself is not weakened here and must not be: the body
/// becomes the squash commit message, so a `pass` recorded against different
/// text really has approved something else. What changes is only WHEN the lane
/// is briefed — after the revision has stopped moving rather than during.
///
/// # The two shapes this deliberately is not
///
/// #1875 offers three candidate fixes and two are refused. A **digest
/// carve-out** — a fenced evidence region excluded from the digest — needs that
/// region to be genuinely un-claim-bearing, and a CI section that also carries

/// writing the CI section itself** puts a second author on the PR body beside
/// the worker, which is a wire change and a new class of §3.1 action, for
/// receipts the worker already produces.
///
/// # The worker ladder is `decide_fix_wait`'s, not a second one
///
/// The four signals are read in the same order and answered with the same
/// holds, because this is the same wait for the same worker on the same
/// hand-back — only its location moved. Reading them by a different rule here
/// is the asymmetry `CLAUDE.md` names ("a guard reads every one of its inputs

/// most: a `Blocked` worker is INVARIANT 3 territory and a dead resumed pane is
/// `worker-unresumable`, and letting either fall through to the timeout below
/// would report both as `fix-stalled` — a claim that the worker went silent,
/// about a worker that said something.
///
/// # The bound, and why it is `fix_timeout_minutes` measured from the push
///
/// A silent worker must not hold the drive for ever, and the wait is the same
/// wait §2.2 already bounds — so it takes the same knob. The anchor is
/// [`DriveEntry::fix_pushed_ms`], the LATEST push in this `ci-wait` stay. Not
/// `fix_handback_ms`, which predates the push and would charge the worker for
/// the time it spent doing the work it was asked to do; and not
/// `state_since_ms`, which is the FIRST push, so a follow-up commit late in the
/// window would get the remainder of a window rather than one (rev-final round
/// 2, premortem 2).
/// [`state_bound_ms`]'s `ci-wait` arm ADDS the same knob to its constant so
/// that `held(state-stalled)` cannot preempt this hold on a repo that raised
/// it — the property [`HeldReason::StateStalled`] states, and the reason that
/// arm is an add rather than a max is argued there.
///
/// **`fix_timeout_minutes` cannot push that bound past the backstop**, which is
/// why this arm needs no counterpart to [`state_bound_ms`]'s `review-wait`
/// residual: `parse_workflow` runs the knob through `clamp_expires_minutes`, so
/// the largest value a workflow file can produce is 240 minutes and the sum
/// tops out at 330 against a twelve-hour `drive_timeout_minutes`. The engine
/// deliberately does not re-clamp the timeouts ([`DriveLimits::clamped`] takes
/// only the counters), so a caller building limits directly can still exceed
/// it — and there the age answers first, exactly as `review-wait`'s residual
/// describes. Pinned at the ceiling by
/// `the_ci_wait_bound_funds_the_receipts_wait_instead_of_preempting_it`.
///
/// # Two residuals, both bounded and both recoverable by the resume
///
/// **A worker pane that DIES here.** #1961's exit read is asked only in
/// `fix-wait` (`rdtick`'s `worker_exit`), so a pane killed while the drive
/// waits in `ci-wait` is not seen as `Unresumable` on the next tick; that drive
/// waits out `fix_timeout_minutes` and parks `held(fix-stalled)`, which is
/// bounded and named but is the slower notice. Disclosed rather than closed:
/// widening the exit read is an S3 change to what a tick OBSERVES, and this
/// slice changes what `decide` does with what it is already given.
///
/// **A worker that pushes and reports inside ONE tick window.** Both facts
/// reach the same tick, [`decide_fix_wait`]'s arc 7 outranks the report on
/// purpose ("the code moved and CI is what has to answer next"), and `rdtick`
/// clears the signal on every arc — so the report is spent on the arc and this
/// state waits for one that will not come, to `held(fix-stalled)`. It is not
/// closed here because a `WorkerSignal` is a word and not a timestamp: the same
/// `Done` beside a moved head is equally consistent with *reported, then
/// pushed*, where the report is about the pre-push tree and honouring it would
/// brief a lane over exactly the unfinished revision #1875 is about. Failing
/// toward a bounded hold rather than toward that defect is the direction this
/// slice takes everywhere, and the ordering is uncommon here by construction —

/// **Both clear on the first tick after `drive_review`**, which is what §2.2

///
/// # The three conditions, and what each excludes
///
/// **1. The step must not PARK the drive.** An `Advance` into `held` releases
/// nothing, and that is not caution — it is what keeps §6's hold notices true: a
/// parked drive's notice says its panes are "still running" and that a
/// `drive_review` resume speaks to them again
/// ([`PaneStanding::Owned`](crate::rddrive::PaneStanding::Owned)), which is a
/// promise about panes the drive still means to use.
///
/// **A TERMINAL step is the opposite case and releases MORE, not less** (#2811 S1).
/// It used to be folded in with `held` here, on the reading that a terminal
/// notice "hands the panes to the orchestrator to dispose of". Measured, that
/// hand-off is a bill: the orchestrator killed the reporting worker in the same
/// second it started 4 of one session's 16 drives, and the next hand-back then
/// resumed the session into a FRESH pane — a spawn per round that a released
/// pane would not have needed. Nothing is being waited for at a terminal step by
/// definition, so both rules below are evaluated and their panes go; what the
/// notice then names is whatever the barrier refused, which is exactly the list
/// an orchestrator still has something to do about.
///
/// A lane released on an EARLIER tick is simply not in
/// [`DriveEntry::owned_panes`] any more, so the notice keeps naming exactly the
/// panes that are still there.
///
/// **This is a condition on the STEP, and the drive can still end the tick
/// parked despite it** (rev-final W1). The step is what `decide` proposed; the
/// tick's ARM can then refuse and park on its own — `Advance{to: FixWait}` whose
/// `rd_handback` cannot resume the worker becomes `held(worker-unresumable)` or
/// `held(cap-refused)` — and by then the release has happened, because the tick
/// performs it BEFORE the arm. Saying "a parking DRIVE releases nothing" would
/// be false there, so it is not said anywhere; what holds is the step.
///
/// **Nothing is lost by the narrower reading, and one thing is gained.** The
/// notices are built after the release, off the live record, so a hold's line
/// still names only panes that are actually there. And releasing before the arm
/// is what stops the commonest way that hold was reached at all: the freed slot
/// is available to `rd_handback`'s own spawn, so a drive whose lane has just
/// answered no longer hits the live-delegate cap handing the fix back.
///
/// **2. A lane's verdict must be CURRENT.** Asked with
/// [`lane_verdict_is_current`] — the same function `review-wait` decides with,
/// never a second implementation of it — over the lane facts this tick READ, so
/// a verdict recorded three commits ago releases nothing. A head that could not
/// be read is empty, `lane_verdict_is_current` is false for it, and the tick
/// releases nothing at all: "we could not check" is not "it has answered".
///
/// **3. The worker must have REPORTED into a drive that is waiting on it — or
/// the drive must be over.** `WorkerSignal::Done` and no other word: `Blocked`
/// is INVARIANT 3 territory and parks the drive for the orchestrator, which is a
/// pane a human is about to talk to. `Silent` has reported nothing at all. And
/// the state condition is what makes "the driver has consumed the report" a fact
/// rather than a description — the signal is one-shot, cleared when the arc it
/// fed is durable, so the tick that sees `Done` while a hand-back is
/// outstanding **and takes an arc on it** is the tick that consumed it. That last clause is load-bearing in `ci-wait`
/// and in `ci-wait` only: there a `Done` can arrive before the matrix settles,
/// [`decide_ci_wait`] answers `Wait`, and nothing has been consumed yet — so
/// the pane is kept for the tick that really does end the wait. In `fix-wait`
/// every `Done` takes an arc (2, or 7 when the head moved under it), so the
/// clause changes nothing there and #2501's rows are unmoved.
///
/// **"Waiting on it" is [`DriveEntry::handback_outstanding`], which since #2168
/// E1 spans TWO states** (#2811 S1). This condition used to read `fix-wait` alone,
/// and E1 moved the report's consumption into `ci-wait` for the ordinary
/// push-then-report ordering — so for every hand-back that actually pushed code,
/// the condition and its consumer never met. Measured on one 6.4-hour session:
/// all 5 releases were body-only fixes, the other 15 of 20 hand-backs held a
/// live-delegate slot through ci-wait and the next review round, and 33 of the
/// orchestrator's pane kills were doing this by hand. The predicate is asked
/// once, on `DriveEntry`, because [`DriveEntry::kickback_owed`] needs the same
/// answer and two spellings of it is how the first drift happened.
///
/// **At a terminal step the word is not read at all** and the reason is
/// [`ReleaseReason::DriveEnded`]: nothing is outstanding, so there is no report
/// to consume and no wait to end. What is checked there is the mirror image —
/// that a hand-back is NOT outstanding, so a `cancelled` that arrives while the
/// worker is mid-round leaves that pane alone.
///
/// # What this deliberately does NOT release
///
/// A lane that has been briefed and has not answered; a lane whose verdict binds
/// to an older revision; a worker that reported `blocked` or has said nothing;
/// a worker still owed a round by a drive that is being `cancelled` under it;
/// a pane belonging to a drive whose STEP parks it this tick (see condition 1
/// for why that is not the same as "a drive that parks"); and every pane in the
/// group that is not this drive's. The orchestrator's kill authority is
/// untouched by all of it — this narrows what the DRIVER may do, and adds
/// nothing anywhere else.
///
/// # The residual, stated because a narrowing must state one
///
/// The worker rule still fires on ONE tick — the arc out of the wait, from
/// either of its two states — and the caller's own half of the decision can
/// refuse it there: a pane still finishing its turn is not idle, and an idle
/// check that says "no" is not retried, because the next tick is no longer
/// waiting on that worker and the fact has expired. What #2811 S1 changes is only
/// WHICH tick that is, not that there is one. The refused case costs exactly
/// what it cost before #2501 (the pane holds its slot until the next hand-back
/// reuses it, per #1960) — and now, additionally, until the drive ENDS, where
/// the terminal rule asks once more without the report's help. So the failure
/// direction is the old behaviour, bounded one exit sooner than it used to be.
///
/// **The tool cancel is not a terminal STEP and is outside all of this.**
/// `cancel_review_drive` ends a drive without a tick, so no `decide` runs, no
/// `releasable` is asked, and its notice names every owned pane as
/// [`PaneStanding::Released`] exactly as it always did. That is deliberate
/// rather than an oversight: the orchestrator that called the tool is the party
/// disposing of the panes, it is awake in the turn that called it, and the
/// notice it gets back is the list. The measured cost this slice is about is
/// paid by drives the DRIVER ends while the orchestrator is doing something
/// else.
///
/// **A worker session two drives share is the one case where a release reaches a
/// pane that is not only this drive's**, and it is disclosed rather than guarded
/// against, because the guard would have to be a claim about another drive's
/// intentions. Nothing stops two `drive_review` calls on different PRs naming one
/// worker session, and after both hand back they name one pane; the `report(done)`
/// that arrives is consumed by whichever drive `rd_owner` matches, so exactly one
/// of them releases it. The other learns on its next tick — `rd_pane_exit` reads
/// the death and names the initiator (`ended by driver-release`), so it parks
/// `held(worker-unresumable)` with a truthful line instead of waiting out
/// `fix-stalled`. That is faster and more informative than the pre-#2501
/// behaviour on the same fixture, where the second drive sat ninety minutes for a
/// report it was never going to be handed; what it is NOT is free, and a repo
/// that drives two PRs off one worker session is already the #338/#359 shape the
/// exit notices warn about.
///
/// The lane rule retries instead of expiring — it is a standing property of the
/// tick's facts — but it is **bounded by which states read those facts**, and
/// that bound is worth naming rather than leaving to be discovered. `facts.
/// required_lanes` is fetched only in `review-wait` and `gate-check`; §2.4 pays
/// for the routed-file list in exactly the states that consult it and nowhere
/// else. So a lane whose pane was still writing when its verdict landed is
/// released on the next tick the drive spends in one of those two states —
/// immediately, while another required lane is outstanding, and otherwise on the
/// drive's next review round. A one-lane gate whose only lane was busy on the
/// tick that read its pass therefore keeps that pane to the exit, where §6's
/// notice names it for the orchestrator exactly as it always did.
