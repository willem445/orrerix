// Per-knob availability for the launcher's model selector (#687 slice B).
//
// The rule this module exists to keep is that loomux never offers a knob it
// cannot deliver, and never SILENTLY drops one either: an unavailable knob is
// disabled with the vendor's own reason, and its value can never reach the
// spawn payload. Three ways a knob is unavailable, and all three are here:
//
//   the CLI has no seam      — copilot's effort lives in ~/.copilot/settings.json
//   loomux never evaluated it — an unknown CLI claims nothing
//   the MODEL has no such form — `haiku[1m]` is not a Claude alias at all
//
// That last one is the #709 review's carried finding: `context:` was gated on
// the CLI and not on the model, so `haiku` + `1m` composed `--model haiku[1m]`,
// an alias the vendor docs do not define. Sources (fetched 2026-08-02, per the
// `agent-cli-reference` discipline): Claude Code model-config §Model aliases
// lists `sonnet[1m]`, `opus[1m]` (and §opusplan `opusplan[1m]`) and no haiku or
// fable form; §Extended context — "Fable 5, Sonnet 5, Opus 4.6 and later, and
// Sonnet 4.6 support a 1 million token context window", "You can also use the
// `[1m]` suffix with model aliases or full model names", and the rule itself:
// "Only append `[1m]` when the underlying model supports 1M context."
