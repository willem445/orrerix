// The pure half of the embed FOCUS-REQUEST hook (#1091 slice C) — DOM/Tauri-free
// so it can be unit-tested (`test/embedfocus.test.ts`); `paneembeds.ts` owns the wiring.
//
// WHAT THE HOOK IS FOR. Two of a pane's embeds now cite each other: a NEEDS-YOU
// card that names a board task (`t-7`) should take you to that row, and — once
// #1091 slice G lands the board marker — a board row held by a question should
// take you back to the card. Both are embeds on the SAME orchestrator pane, so
// neither direction is a backend round trip; it is one pane opening its own
// other view and telling it which item the human asked for.
//
// WHY IT NEEDS STATE AT ALL. The obvious spelling — "open the view, then call
// `focusItem(id)` on it" — cannot work here, because every embed is LAZILY
// CONSTRUCTED (`ensureTasksView`, `ensureDecisionsView`, …) and, once
// constructed, renders from an ASYNC refresh. At the instant the request is
// made the target view may not exist, and even when it does its list may not
// yet hold the row being asked for. So the request is parked, and the view
// drains it on its own next render, when the rows are actually there. That is
// the "survives lazy construction" property this module exists to hold.
//
// CONSUMED EXACTLY ONCE, and that is the load-bearing rule. A view re-renders
// constantly (an `orch-tasks-changed` burst, a poll, a human edit), so a
// request that stayed set would re-scroll and re-highlight on every one of
// them — yanking the viewport back long after the human had scrolled somewhere
// else. `take` is therefore destructive, and `peek` exists only for tests and
// assertions that must not consume.
