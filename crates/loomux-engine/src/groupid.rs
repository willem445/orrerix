//! `GroupId` — the validated identifier every group-scoped path is built from
//! (#904).
//!
//! # Why this type exists
//!
//! CLAUDE.md hard constraint 6 **used to say** orchestration commands trust
//! `group_id` as a path segment; #904 is why it no longer does. That trust was
//! never a credential: it was derived from
//! **process locality** — the only caller able to invoke a `#[tauri::command]`
//! is our own in-process webview. `group_dir()` was `self.root.join(group)`, no
//! validation, no canonicalization, and the one membership guard on that path
//! lived in `save_attachment` alone.
//!
//! #888 §0 layer 2 is what breaks it: reproduce the command surface over a
//! socket and "the caller is our webview" stops being a fact about the process
//! and becomes an assumption about the network. A peer that can send
//! `group_id: "../../../../Users/me/.ssh"` gets a path join for free.
//!
//! So the trust moves off the transport and onto a **type**. A `GroupId` can be
//! built exactly one way — [`GroupId::parse`] — and that constructor refuses
//! anything that is not a single, path-safe, ASCII identifier. There is no
//! `From<String>`, no public field, no `new_unchecked`. Deserialization goes
//! through the same check, so a hand-edited state file cannot mint one either.
//!
//! Deliberately **not** implemented: `AsRef<Path>`. A `GroupId` must not be
//! joinable directly — it becomes a path only inside `orchestration::group_dir_at`,
//! the single declared assembly point (#904 scope item 2), which
//! `OrchRegistry::group_dir` is the `&self` convenience over. That is plain
//! text rather than an intra-doc link because it lives in `src-tauri`, the
//! crate that depends on this one; the arrow never points back, so this module
//! cannot name it in a path.
//!
//! Two independent things hold that up, because the missing `AsRef<Path>` only
//! stops a `GroupId` reaching a `join` — it says nothing about the *string*
//! inside one, which would compile fine. The second is a source-scanning test,
//! `the_orchestration_root_is_joined_with_a_group_in_exactly_one_place` in
//! `src-tauri/tests/groupid.rs`, which parses every `.join(` argument in
//! production source and flags any naming a group.
//!
//! **That scan walks BOTH workspace source roots** — `src-tauri/src` and
//! `crates/loomux-engine/src` — and the second root is not symmetry for its own
//! sake. Once this module moved here (#888 slice A2), the orphan rule left
//! nowhere else an `impl AsRef<Path> for GroupId` could legally be written: a
//! scan confined to `src-tauri/src` would have been watching a directory the
//! violation can no longer reach, i.e. green forever while enforcing nothing.
//!
//! Its limits are enumerated where it is implemented, and they are limits
//! rather than a single caveat: it matches the qualified and bare spellings of
//! both `AsRef` and `Path`, but it is a textual scan, so an aliased import
//! (`use std::path::Path as P`), a macro-generated impl, an impl header split
//! across lines, and `PathBuf::push` (indistinguishable from `Vec::push`) all
//! sit outside it. What actually holds the property is the compiler: with no
//! `AsRef<Path>` in the tree, a `GroupId` cannot reach a `join` as a value at
//! all. The scan is defence in depth over the *string* inside one.
//!
//! It exists because this exact sentence was false for a whole slice: `#904`'s
//! first half left `append_audit` and `promptsubmit_marker_path` each joining
//! the root themselves, and only a reviewer noticed — then the first version of
//! the guard was a fixed needle list that missed the very spelling the fix had
//! deleted, and a reviewer noticed that too. See
//! `docs/design/groupid-and-path-roots.md`.
//!
//! # The alphabet, and why it is this one
//!
//! Group ids are loomux-minted tokens, never user prose: `group_id_for_repo`
//! emits `{slug}-{8hex}` (slug = ASCII alphanumerics/`-`/`_` from the repo
//! directory name, ≤24 chars), `create_group_ex` may append `-{n}` to
//! disambiguate concurrent groups on one repo, and `SOLO_GROUP` is the fixed
//! constant `__solo__`. A strict alphabet therefore costs nothing and rejects
//! every path-shaped attack by construction rather than by enumeration:
//! `/` and `\` (separators), `.` (so `..` and `.` are unspellable), `:` (drive
//! letters, NTFS alternate data streams), NUL and every other control byte,
//! whitespace, and every non-ASCII byte (which is where Unicode
//! normalization/homoglyph confusion would otherwise live).
//!
//! The rules themselves are no longer written here. #925 found four
//! near-identical copies of them across the tree — this one,
//! `mergeq::valid_id_component`, `orchestration::sanitize_session` and
//! `digest::is_safe_session_id` — which were not four copies so much as four
//! points on a slope, the weakest of them guarding a live `Path::join`. They now
//! share one checker, [`pathseg::check_segment`](crate::pathseg::check_segment).
//!
//! `GroupId` nevertheless stays a distinct **type**, and that is the part worth
//! keeping separate: a `bool` returned by a free function is a fact about a
//! moment, where a `GroupId` is a fact that travels with the value — and a group
//! id and a session id must not be substitutable for one another at a call site
//! merely because both are path-safe. Shared checks, distinct types.
//!
//! **Rejected, never rewritten.** `parse` does not trim, lowercase, or sanitize:
//! an id is either usable as-is or refused. Normalizing would let two distinct
//! strings name one directory, which is how a membership check and a path join
//! end up disagreeing.
