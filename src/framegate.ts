// P5 (docs/design/performance.md §2) as a reusable module: a rAF dirty-flag
// gate that turns "repaint per batch" into "repaint per frame".
//
// The shape is `FileExplorer.onFilesBatch`'s `ft-files` gate — a boolean plus
// one `requestAnimationFrame` — lifted out so a second stream can adopt it
// without re-deriving it, and so the coalescing itself is unit-testable. The
// gate is what stands between a batch stream and the webview thread: a backend
// walk emitting hundreds of batches costs one paint per frame, not one per
// batch, and the paint cost is a function of the DOM, not of how fast the
// producer streams (#743 S5, INV-3).
//
// The scheduler is injected so `node --test` can drive frames deterministically
// (test/framegate.test.ts). Nothing here touches the DOM.

/** Schedules `cb` for the next frame. Defaults to `requestAnimationFrame`. */
