//! In-app file tree + code editor backend (issue #174).
//!
//! Powers the per-pane file-editor overlay: a lazy directory tree, file
//! read/write, and a project-wide text search + replace. Every command takes a
//! `root` (the pane's live cwd) and a `rel` path *relative to that root*; the
//! webview is trusted but paths still cross the IPC boundary, so **all** path
//! safety is enforced here, defense-in-depth (CLAUDE.md constraint #6):
//!
//!   * absolute `rel` is rejected;
//!   * `.`/`..` are folded lexically (never `fs::canonicalize`, which yields a
//!     `\\?\`-verbatim path some Windows toolchains mishandle) and the result
//!     must stay inside the normalized `root`;
//!   * we refuse to traverse, read, or write *through* a symlinked component,
//!     since not canonicalizing means a symlink could otherwise redirect a
//!     lexically-in-root path to somewhere outside it.
//!
//! Writes are atomic + durable (temp in the same dir → `write_all` → `sync_all`
//! fsync → `rename`, with a direct-write fallback), the exact #133/#161 pattern
//! already duplicated in `orchestration::atomic_write` and `uistate::write_atomic`
//! — a third private copy here matches house style. A content hash returned by
//! `ft_read_file` and re-checked by `ft_write_file` gives optimistic
//! conflict detection: if the file changed on disk since it was read (the agent,
//! another tool, or the git watcher touched it), the write is refused untouched.
//!
//! No new crates: the hash is a std-only FNV-1a and temp names use an
//! `AtomicU64` + `process::id()`, never uuid/rand/tempfile-in-prod (the
//! getrandom / ProcessPrng ban, CLAUDE.md constraint #2). Search is a pure-`std`
//! walker — dependency-free, getrandom-safe, and bounded so a huge repo can't
//! wedge the UI.
//!
//! Search runs off the UI thread and streams (issue #207). `ft_search` was a
//! *synchronous* command: Tauri runs sync commands on the main (webview) thread,
//! so a full-tree walk that reads tens of thousands of files froze the whole UI
//! for its duration — and the debounced auto-search relaunched that walk on every
//! keystroke. `ft_search_start` instead spawns a worker thread that walks, emits
//! `ft-search` batches as they're found (tagged with the caller's search id), and
//! polls a per-search cancel flag so a superseded search (new keystroke) or an
//! `Esc` stops promptly instead of running to completion. Enumeration is
//! gitignore-aware by default: in a git repo it uses `git ls-files` (tracked +
//! untracked-unignored) so `.gitignore`d paths are skipped for free; the
//! `include_ignored` toggle (or a non-git root) falls back to the full walk. The
//! git call is a plain subprocess — still no new crate, still getrandom-safe.

// up to 2 MiB, an fsync-ed atomic write, and (`ft_replace`) that write over an
// unbounded number of files. The streaming commands below (`ft_search_start`,
