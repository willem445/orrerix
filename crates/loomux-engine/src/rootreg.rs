//! `RootRegistry` — the server-declared filesystem roots a caller-supplied
//! root/cwd argument must name (#1042, #888 §0 layer 2 / §1.1 H3).
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! #904 closed `group_id` and #925 closed the identifier families that become a
//! path *component*. Neither touches the other half of §0's "server-declared
//! roots": the `ft_*`/`fm_*`/`git_*`/`gh_*` families take a caller-supplied
//! **absolute root** and check it with `is_dir()` and nothing else. No segment
//! validator can express that check, because there is no predicate over a
//! string that separates a repo from `~/.ssh` — the difference is not in the
//! path's shape, it is in whether anybody ever declared it.
//!
//! Today those commands are safe for exactly the reason `group_id` used to be:
//! the only caller able to invoke a `#[tauri::command]` is our own in-process
//! webview. That is a fact about the transport, not a credential. Reproduce the
//! command surface over a socket (#888) and every peer that can connect becomes
//! "the webview" — and an arbitrary absolute root is then an arbitrary read.
//!
//! So the trust moves off the transport and onto **server-held state**: a root
//! is usable iff it is in this registry, and only sources the engine itself
//! trusts can put one there.
//!
//! # This is wire enforcement, not a local sandbox
//!
//! The registry does not exist to constrain the local desktop. The local webview
//! already owns the disk; it may admit anything, so desktop behaviour does not
//! regress by construction. The teeth are entirely in what *cannot* admit: the
//! wire gets no admit path at all (`admit_root` is classified off-roster), so a
//! remote peer can **use** declared roots and can never **mint** one.
//!
//! # Never persisted
//!
//! There is deliberately no `Serialize`/`Deserialize` on either type in this
//! module, and the registry is rebuilt from its trusted sources on every boot.
//! A persisted registry file would be precisely the replay-poisonable artifact
//! this design has to defeat: an entry admitted once — or injected into the file
//! — would outlive every reason it was admitted for. Rebuilt-from-trusted-sources
//! makes replay poisoning structurally impossible at this layer, which is why
//! the absent impls are load-bearing rather than an omission.
//!
//! # The descendant rule
//!
//! [`RootRegistry::resolve`] accepts a candidate whose canonical form **equals
//! or is a descendant of** a declared root, and refuses everything else —
//! notably an **ancestor**, which would grant strictly *more* than was declared.
//! A subdirectory grants strictly less, so a pane that `cd`s around inside an
//! admitted repo keeps working without anything new being declared, while a pane
//! that `cd`s to `~/.ssh` resolves to nothing.
//!
//! # `plain` vs `canonical`, and why both
//!
//! `std::fs::canonicalize` on Windows returns an extended-length path
//! (`\\?\C:\…`). That is exactly right as a **comparison key** — it resolves
//! symlinks and junctions, and it normalizes the case Windows does not care
//! about — and exactly wrong as a **working path**: MSYS git does not want one
//! as a subprocess `current_dir`, and no user wants to read one. So
//! [`DeclaredRoot`] carries both, and [`DeclaredRoot::as_path`] hands back
//! `plain` — the caller's own path with `.` folded away, and only `.` (see
//! [`lexical_normalize`], which is deliberately *not* a copy of
//! `fileedit::safe_resolve`'s fold). Commands therefore go on feeding
//! git/gh/the filesystem the same shape of path they do today.
//!
//! For that split to be safe the two must never name *different* directories,
//! which is the entire reason a `..` component is refused rather than folded: a
//! `..` after a symlink resolves one way through the filesystem and another way
//! under a lexical fold, and the consumers of `plain` — `fileedit::safe_resolve`
//! first among them — fold. See [`RootError::ParentTraversal`], which carries
//! the measured case.
//!
//! # Not `AsRef<Path>`
//!
//! Mirroring `GroupId`'s refusal: [`DeclaredRoot`] has exactly one accessor,
//! [`DeclaredRoot::as_path`], so every place a declared root becomes a working
//! path is greppable. A blanket `AsRef<Path>` would make it invisible again.
//! There is likewise no public constructor, no `From<String>` and no
//! `Deserialize` — the only way to mint a `DeclaredRoot` is
//! [`RootRegistry::resolve`], so holding one is proof that *some* trusted source
//! declared a root containing it.
//!
//! Holding one is **not** membership. "May this caller touch this root?" is a
//! separate question, exactly as it is for a `GroupId`.
//!
//! See `docs/design/groupid-and-path-roots.md`.
