//! The manager mailbox (#1161 slice M2) — the durable, **pull-consumed**
//! channel from the orchestrator to the human's own pane.
//!
//! # Why a registry, and not a channel
//!
//! Every other agent-to-agent path in loomux is push: a producer calls
//! `deliver_prompt`, loomux waits for the target pane to look idle, and pastes
//! the text into its CLI. Cross-workspace channels ride that path
//! (`channel_send` → `deliver_prompt(.., Delivery::MidSession)`), and #271 W1
//! explicitly rejected a pull-based `channel_read()` on the grounds that *the
//! pane transcript already is the inbox*.
//!
//! **For the manager's pane that principle inverts.** Its transcript is not a
//! work log — it is a human's conversation, in progress, with a human's
//! attention on it. Text loomux types into it is text the human did not write
//! and did not ask for, appearing mid-sentence in their own dialogue. So the
//! hard requirement on this feature (#1161 requirement 4) is that **nothing is
//! ever injected into a manager pane**, which leaves a push channel with
//! nowhere to deliver.
//!
//! Hence a registry: `mailbox.json` in the group dir, beside `questions.json`
//! and `tasks.json`, written by the orchestrator through `message_manager` and
//! read by the manager through `check_mail` on its own turn. The human is the
//! scheduler of the manager's attention; the mailbox is what the manager finds
//! waiting when the human next speaks to it.
//!
//! This module is modelled on `src-tauri/src/orchestration/humanq.rs`, the
//! human-question registry — down to the id minting, the retention idiom and
//! the refuse-rather-than-truncate posture, because a reader who knows one
//! should not have to learn the other. Where it deliberately differs, the doc
//! comment says so.
//!
//! # The trust posture — read this before changing a cap
//!
//! **Write rights are asymmetric, exactly as `questions.json`'s are.** The
//! orchestrator writes; the manager reads and marks read. Neither can do the
//! other's half, and no other role reaches either — enforced in `mcp.rs` at
//! both the listing and the dispatch (the #243 double gate), not here.
//!
//! **A row's `from` and `kind` are loomux-built, never caller-supplied
//! strings.** `from` is the calling agent's own id as the MCP server resolved
//! it; `kind` is parsed from a closed set by [`Kind::parse`], which errors on
//! anything unrecognized rather than defaulting. There is therefore no
//! spelling of "post as someone else", so there is nothing to validate and
//! nothing to forge — `humanq::AnswerSource`'s argument applied to a
//! cheaper surface.
//!
//! **`text` is the one caller-authored field, and it is sanitized on the way
//! IN.** It passes [`crate::notify::sanitize_pane_text`] with `Lines::Keep`
//! before it is stored, so a stored row can never contain a `[loomux]` span
//! (the brackets are mapped to parentheses) or a bare control character. Two
//! things about that choice are deliberate:
//!
//! - **`Lines::Keep`, not `Collapse`** — `relay_payload_keeping_lines`'s
//!   argument, for its reason. A status update is prose with structure; a
//!   status update reflowed into one paragraph on its way to the human's
//!   interface is a legibility regression smuggled in by a hardening pass. The
//!   guarantee needs the token neutralized, not the line breaks removed.
//! - **On the way in, not on the way out** — unlike a notice, which is
//!   composed fresh each time it is sent. This row is stored once and read
//!   back by whatever surface asks (the tool, the unread-count command, a
//!   human opening the file). Sanitizing at every reader is a rule that drifts;
//!   sanitizing at the single writer is one that cannot.
//!
//! # What this module is not
//!
//! It is not the no-injection guarantee. That lives at `deliver_prompt`, which
//! refuses a `Role::Manager` target outright — see `docs/design/manager.md`.
//! The mailbox is what makes the refusal *survivable*: without somewhere for
//! orchestrator-to-manager traffic to go, "never inject" would just mean
//! "never communicate".
