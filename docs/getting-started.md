## Install

Orrerix ships as a native desktop app for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Pick
whichever install path suits you — they all land on the same app.

> **Coming from Loomux?** The npm package (`loomux-desktop`), the command
> (`loomux`) and the installed app have all been renamed, with no compatibility
> shim — see [Upgrading from Loomux](#upgrading-from-loomux) below.

### npm (any platform)

If you already have **Node 18+**, the quickest path is the tiny launcher
package:

```sh
npx orrerix            # download + launch in one shot
npm install -g orrerix # then run `orrerix` anytime
```

`orrerix` is a small, dependency-free launcher: it fetches the matching
release asset for your platform (Windows installer, macOS `.dmg`, or Linux
`AppImage`), installs/caches it, and launches it.

```sh
orrerix            # launch the installed app (installs it first if missing)
orrerix update     # install/refresh the app from the newest release on your channel
orrerix version    # print the launcher's version
orrerix help       # full usage
```

Plain `orrerix` **never** updates an existing install. Installing over a running
Orrerix closes it — and everything running inside it — so when you update is your
call, not the launcher's.

`orrerix update` picks the newest release **on the channel you are already on**
and never installs an older build over a newer one:

| You have installed | `orrerix update` gives you |
| --- | --- |
| a stable release (`1.0.0`) | the newest **stable** release |
| a beta/RC (`1.1.0-beta11`) | the newest release of either kind |

If the launcher cannot read the version of your installed Orrerix, `orrerix
update` stops and says so rather than guessing — it has no way to tell an update
from a downgrade, so it does neither. Installing your preferred build once from
the releases page clears it.

To move from stable onto the beta train (or back), install that build yourself
from [the releases page](https://github.com/willem445/orrerix/releases) — the
launcher will not switch channels for you. On Linux the app is a cached
AppImage, so `orrerix update` refreshes the cache; quit the running AppImage
first, since it cannot be overwritten while it is running.

`orrerix --reinstall` still works as a deprecated alias for `orrerix update`, but
its meaning changed in v1.1: it used to install the version matching the
launcher itself, and now it installs the newest release on your channel.

### Upgrading from Loomux

The launcher used to be published as `loomux-desktop` and installed a command
called `loomux`. Both were renamed with the app, and there is no compatibility
shim. `loomux-desktop` has also been removed from npm entirely, so
`npx loomux-desktop` and `npm install -g loomux-desktop` now fail rather than
installing anything.

If you installed it globally before that, the `loomux` command is still on your
machine — removing a package from the registry does not remove it from your disk:

```sh
npm uninstall -g loomux-desktop
npm install -g orrerix
```

The new launcher still recognises an app installed under the old name, so
`orrerix update` sees the version you already have and will not downgrade it,
and a Linux AppImage the old launcher cached is launched rather than
re-downloaded.

What it does **not** do is replace a Loomux install in place — see
[Loomux and Orrerix install side by side](#loomux-and-orrerix-install-side-by-side).

### Windows (one-liner)

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c "irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/willem445/orrerix/main/install.ps1 | iex"
```

### macOS / Linux (one-liner)

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/willem445/orrerix/main/install.sh | sh
```

### Release assets (manual)

Prefer to grab an installer yourself? Every build is published to
[the GitHub releases page](https://github.com/willem445/orrerix/releases) —
beta/RC builds included, which the `latest` link does not show:

| Platform | Asset |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | `*-setup.exe` (installer) or `*.msi` |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `*_aarch64.dmg` |
| macOS (Intel) | `*_x64.dmg` |
| Linux | `*.AppImage` (portable), `*.deb`, or `*.rpm` |

Builds are **unsigned** for now. On macOS, if the app is reported as damaged,
clear the quarantine attribute:

```sh
xattr -cr /Applications/Orrerix.app
```

(The install script does this for you.)

### Loomux and Orrerix install side by side

If you already had Loomux, installing Orrerix leaves **both** apps on your
machine. That is not something the installer can avoid: it identifies an
existing install by the product name — the Windows Add/Remove entry and install
directory, and the macOS bundle directory, are all named after it — so a
renamed app has nothing to recognise and installs fresh.

Nothing removes the old one for you, deliberately: it is a working app you
installed, and quietly deleting it is not the installer's call. Uninstall Loomux
whenever you are ready — Add/Remove Programs on Windows, or
`rm -rf /Applications/Loomux.app` on macOS. On Linux there is nothing to do:
the AppImage is a single file, and the one on your PATH is simply replaced.

**Until you do, plain `orrerix` launches the Loomux you already have.** That is
the same rule as always — a plain launch never installs anything over an
existing install, on any platform — and the launcher counts your Loomux as an
existing install on purpose, because that is what keeps it from downgrading you.
Run `orrerix update` to get the Orrerix build; after that, plain `orrerix`
launches Orrerix, because the launcher prefers the current app when both are
there.

Your data is not duplicated and nothing needs migrating — both builds read the
same profile directory, which moved separately and earlier.

### Upgrading from an earlier Orrerix build

The executable inside the install is now `orrerix.exe`; earlier Orrerix builds
carried `loomux.exe`. Installing over one of those — **with the old build closed**
— replaces it in place and removes the old executable for you, and no second app
appears in Add/Remove Programs. Closed is the part that matters: see the first
bullet below.

Two things to know:

- **Quit Orrerix before installing it by hand.** If the old build is still
  running its executable cannot be deleted, so it is left behind next to the new
  one — and it stays there for good: later installs will not remove it, and
  neither will uninstalling. It is inert, and Orrerix never runs it, but if you
  want the space back you have to delete it yourself from the install folder
  (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Orrerix`). Quitting first avoids the whole thing.
  `orrerix update` refuses outright while the app is running rather than
  installing over it.
- **A few settings may come back to their defaults, once.** The recent-repos
  list, the default agent, the custom agent command and the editor command are
  kept by the app's browser profile, which 1.2.0-beta7 moves to a new location
  along with everything else. It moves by itself on Windows and Linux — unless
  the previous build is still running, the same reason as the bullet above — and
  on macOS it is not moved at all, so those settings start fresh there and macOS
  asks for microphone permission again the first time you use voice input. Your
  groups, tasks, tabs and logs are somewhere else entirely and are not affected.
  [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.html) has the details.
- **Re-pin your taskbar shortcut.** A shortcut you pinned yourself points at the
  old executable and stops working. The Start-menu and desktop shortcuts the
  installer created are updated for you; pin a fresh one from there.

Crash dumps written by Windows are named after the executable, so they are now
`orrerix.exe.<pid>.dmp` — see [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.html).

## First launch

Open orrerix and you get a single terminal pane running your default shell — it
behaves like any native terminal, because under the hood it *is* one (real
ConPTY on Windows, forkpty on macOS/Linux, via WezTerm's PTY layer). Colors,
escape sequences, and wide characters render exactly as they would natively.

From here you can:

- **Split** the pane into a matrix — `Ctrl+Shift+E` (right) or `Ctrl+Shift+O`
  (down). See [Core concepts](core-concepts.html) for the whole grid model.
- **Pick a shell** on the **Terminal** kind of the welcome screen — PowerShell,
  Command Prompt, or Git Bash. Git Bash is offered only when Git for Windows is
  installed; otherwise it's shown disabled with that reason, and any pane still
  falls back to PowerShell rather than failing to start.
- **Name** a pane with `F2` so you can tell your agents apart.
- **Restore a past agent session** with the session browser (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) —
  it scans your machine for resumable Claude Code, Copilot CLI, OpenCode, pi and
  Codex sessions and drops the one you pick back into a pane, in its original
  folder.
  See the [session browser](features/session-browser.html).

## Your first agent pane

Orrerix is built to run AI coding agents, but it doesn't bundle them — it drives
the CLIs you already have installed. The four first-class ones are:

- **[Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)** — the `claude` CLI.
- **[GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli)** — the
  `copilot` CLI.
- **[OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/)** — the `opencode` CLI.
- **[pi](https://pi.dev/)** — the `pi` CLI.

Make sure at least one is installed and on your `PATH`. Then, to open an agent
in a pane:

1. Open a new pane (`Ctrl+Shift+E`/`O` to split, `Ctrl+Shift+T` for a new tab).
   Every pane starts on the **welcome / pane-setup screen**.
2. Choose the **Agent** kind, pick the agent CLI and model, leave **Panes** at 1,
   and click **Create**.

The **Repository** field remembers your most recent directories: pick one from
its dropdown (newest first) instead of browsing again. The field still accepts
any path — type one, or use **Browse…** — and every launch or Browse… pick is
recorded for the dropdown's list (the most recent 8 are kept).

The **orrerix subagents** checkbox (off by default) makes this pane a **lead**:
its helpers open as orrerix panes, in their own worktrees, where you can read and
steer them, instead of running invisibly inside the CLI's own process. Ticking it
also shows the four guardrail numbers that will govern those helpers. It is
offered for claude, copilot and pi, and only on a tab that does not already run
an orchestration project — [orrerix subagents](features/orrerix-subagents.html)
has the whole story, including what a restart does and does not bring back.

The **Autopilot — pre-approve all tools** checkbox (on by default) launches the
agent with tools pre-approved so it stops prompting you to approve each edit or
command — Claude Code's native Auto mode plus pre-approved `git`/`gh`, or, for
Copilot, the same true autopilot mode an orchestration worker gets (`--autopilot
--allow-all-tools --allow-all-paths`). Copilot only opens its blocking "Enable
autopilot mode" dialog on the pane's first submit, which for a lone pane is your
own first Enter — so orrerix runs a watcher that answers it for you rather than
leaving it on screen. For OpenCode it's `--auto`, which answers each permission
ask itself as it comes up rather than opening a separate confirmation dialog, so
no watcher is needed on a fresh launch. Uncheck the box to launch in the CLI's
normal interactive mode. Orrerix never uses `--dangerously-skip-permissions`.
Your last choice is remembered for next time.

That posture survives a **restore**, too (an app restart, or resuming from the
session browser) — but only when orrerix launched the session itself *and*
recorded an unambiguous toggle state for it. For Claude that record is per
session, so it's never ambiguous; for Copilot — which hands orrerix no session id
at launch — it's per folder, so two sessions launched from the same folder with
the toggle flipped between them deliberately resolve to *no* flags rather than a
guess. A session with no such record comes back in plain interactive mode instead
of guessing; `Shift+Tab` still cycles it into autopilot by hand. OpenCode keeps
no restore-posture record yet, so a restored OpenCode pane always comes back
plain — same `Shift+Tab` fallback.

Want more than one agent? Set **Panes** above 1 on the Agent kind to spawn *N*
independent agent panes at once. And when you're ready to hand a whole queue of
work to a fleet that manages itself, that's the
[orchestration guide](orchestration.html).

## What you need installed

| For | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Running an agent pane | `claude`, `copilot`, `opencode` and/or `pi` on your `PATH` |
| The issues/PR view and the orchestration PR workflow | `gh` CLI, authenticated (`gh auth login`) |
| Voice prompts (Windows, opt-in) | a whisper.cpp runtime + a model — see [Voice prompts](features/voice-prompts.html) |

If a required CLI is missing, orrerix tells you inline rather than failing
silently — the launcher warns when a selected role's CLI isn't installed, and
the issues panel says so if `gh` isn't set up.
