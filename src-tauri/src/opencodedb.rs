//! Read-only reads of OpenCode's SQLite session store (#722).
//!
//! OpenCode keeps sessions, messages and parts in **one SQLite database**, not
//! the per-project JSON tree its troubleshooting page still describes — that
//! layout survives only as migration code (`SOURCE`, `storage/storage.ts`).
//! loomux points each group's panes at their own file through `OPENCODE_DB`
//! (see `orchestration::OPENCODE_DB_ENV` and `docs/design/opencode.md`), so the
//! store this module reads is one loomux created and one only that group's
//! agents write.
//!
//! # The schema this module depends on
//!
//! Verified against `anomalyco/opencode@f67e80c2` (tag `v1.18.11`) and a live
//! store on the maintainer's machine; recorded in full on issue #722 (slice-V
//! memo, §1b). The columns read here, verbatim from that DDL:
//!
//! ```sql
//! CREATE TABLE `session` (
//!   `id` text PRIMARY KEY, `project_id` text NOT NULL, `parent_id` text,
//!   `directory` text NOT NULL, … `model` text,
//!   `cost` real DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL,
//!   `tokens_input` integer DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL,
//!   `tokens_output` integer DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL,
//!   `tokens_reasoning` integer DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL,
//!   `tokens_cache_read` integer DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL,
//!   `tokens_cache_write` integer DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL, … )
//! ```
//!
//! That schema is a vendor's internal detail with no compatibility promise, so
//! every failure mode here is **degraded, never fatal**: a store that is
//! absent, unopenable, or shaped differently than the above yields
//! [`Unavailable`] rather than an error, and what that means is the caller's
//! call — the polled usage meter reports zero and moves on, while a digest,
//! whose entire product is the transcript it came to read, surfaces the reason
//! instead of returning an empty one (see `session_transcript`). Nothing in
//! this module panics, retries in a loop, or blocks for longer than
//! [`BUSY_TIMEOUT_MS`] — it runs on the polled `group_usage` path, where a
//! wedge would freeze a UI tick.
//!
//! The variant is not decoration: degrading is not the same as being
//! undiagnosable, and `OrchRegistry::note_opencode_db_degrade` turns these into
//! one audit line per episode so a drifted schema and a never-booted pane stop
//! looking alike. Which is why [`Unavailable::Query`] carries its message and
//! [`Unavailable::Absent`] is a distinct arm rather than one more error string.
//!
//! # Read-only, and why not `immutable`
//!
//! The primary open is `SQLITE_OPEN_READ_ONLY`: SQLite refuses every write on
//! such a connection, so loomux cannot corrupt or lock out a live opencode no
//! matter what this code does. It is deliberately *not* `immutable=1` in the
//! normal case — an immutable connection skips locking and reads the main
//! database file alone, which on a WAL store means silently missing everything
//! committed but not yet checkpointed. For a live agent that is most of the
//! session, and a usage meter that under-reports spend without saying so is
//! worse than one that reports nothing. A read-only connection consults the
//! WAL and sees the last committed state.
//!
//! `immutable=1` survives only as a **fallback** ([`open_immutable`]), for the
//! one case where the plain read-only open cannot work: an opencode that died
//! without checkpointing leaves a dirty `-wal` behind, and rebuilding the
//! `-shm` index that would need is a write. There, a possibly-stale number
//! beats no number, and the staleness is bounded by whatever that dead process
//! failed to checkpoint.

/// learning.md`'s ambiguity policy already settled which way to fail: a refused
/// match costs a pane that stays unidentified (degrading exactly as an
/// opencode pane does today), while a wrong one silently reports one agent's
/// spend as another's and resumes a human into a conversation that is not the

/// `message_json` repeats across every part of one message, which is why
/// `message_id` rides along: the normalizer parses a message document once and
/// reuses it until that id changes, rather than re-parsing it per part.
