// The workflow pane's DECISIONS, pure (#222 v2, rev-15). DOM-free and I/O-free — the same
// move `dirtystate.ts` makes for the editor: the view is left with the wiring, and the rules it
// used to hold in its head are stated once, here, where they are unit-tested.
//
// Every rule in this file is here because getting it wrong cost something real in review:
//
//   * `paneSurface` — the pane showed its "no workflow here" start surface for a file that was
//     THERE and merely unreadable, and then offered to create a starter over the top of it.
//   * `savePlan` — a "create" wrote with a null expected hash, which the backend reads as
//     *write unconditionally*, so a workflow that appeared after the pane opened was destroyed
//     with a green "Saved" toast.
//   * `layoutPruneIds` — a drag pruned the layout file against the UNSAVED buffer, so deleting
//     a block (without saving) and then dragging another one wrote the deletion into
//     `workflow.layout.json` on disk before the human had committed it to `workflow.yml`.
//   * `inspectorTarget` / `surfaceForFinding` / `canvasDeleteAllowed` (#880 slice B) — the view
//     decided, per call site, whether a selection was worth *showing*. It got it wrong in the
//     one place it mattered most: clicking a block on the canvas selected it and re-rendered
//     the property form BEHIND the tab the human was not looking at, so click-to-edit — the
//     headline ask on #880 — appeared to do nothing at all.
//
// None of those is a rendering bug or a wiring bug. They are all the view answering a question
// it should never have been holding the answer to.

 *  file; the other must not, because creating means overwriting a file we just refused to show

 *
 *  THE LIVE BUG, and it is the one this whole file was supposed to have already prevented. The
 *  "Create workflow" button lives on the start surface, and the pane's only defence against
 *  scaffolding over a workflow that was already loaded was that the button is *supposed to be
 *  invisible* anywhere else. It wasn't: a `display: flex` class rule out-specifies the `hidden`
 *  attribute (see the `[hidden]` note at the top of styles.css), so all three surfaces rendered
 *  at once and the button sat there, live, on top of a workflow the pane had read and validated.
 *  Pressing it destroyed that workflow.
 *
 *  And `savePlan`'s claim-then-write (F2) did not catch it, because from the save's point of view
 *  nothing was wrong: the pane KNEW the file was there and held its hash, so the plan was an
 *  ordinary guarded write, the hash matched, and the backend wrote exactly what it was told to
 *  write. Every guard downstream of the button was working. The button should not have been
 *  pressable.
 *
 *  So: VISIBILITY IS NOT A SAFETY PROPERTY. Creating is permitted on the START surface and
 *  nowhere else — the same single decision that puts the button on screen — which means the
 *  button cannot be pressed in a state where pressing it would overwrite anything. And because
 *  the start surface is *by definition* "no file on disk, nothing in the buffer", every create it
 *  permits is a `claim-then-write`, which is the property the test in workflowpane.test.ts pins:
 *  a create can never even be *asked* to clobber. */

/** What the inspector shows for the current selection.
 *
 *  THE RULE THE TABS USED TO BREAK (#880). Before this, the property form lived behind a
 *  "Blocks" tab and the canvas behind a "Graph" tab, so *selecting* something and *showing* it
 *  were two separate acts — and the canvas performed only the first. `onCanvasDown` set the
 *  selection and re-rendered the form, off screen, behind the tab the human was not on; the
 *  gate box remembered to call `setTab("form")` and the node handler did not. Clicking a block
 *  therefore appeared to do nothing, which is the exact interaction #880 was opened about.
 *
 *  With the inspector docked beside the canvas there is no second act to forget: the selection
 *  IS what the inspector shows, and this function is the whole of that. What is left is the two
 *  ways a selection can outlive the thing it points at, which the view used to handle by
 *  reassigning its own selection field and calling itself recursively:
 *
 *    * a BLOCK index past the end of the roster — the block was deleted here, or by a hand edit
 *      in the YAML view;
 *    * an EDGE the workflow no longer declares — erased here, or edited away in the YAML.
 *
 *  Both fall back to the workflow's own settings rather than rendering an editor over nothing.
 *
 *  `syntaxBroken` short-circuits everything, and that is the one rule this pane has never been
 *  allowed to bend: a form edit serializes the model back over the buffer, so editing a model we
 *  only half understood would silently destroy the broken text the human is in the middle of
 *  fixing. Unparseable YAML disables the editor and says why — it does not fall back to a

 *  own hash — which makes even the sliver between the claim and the write an ordinary,

 *  file loomux itself wrote that costs nothing. For a file a HUMAN wrote, the comments are
 *  frequently the most valuable lines in it: this repo's own workflow file is 126
 *  lines of which 60 are comments explaining the roster and the `.github/agents/` convention —
 *  and Format would silently take all 60 without this.
