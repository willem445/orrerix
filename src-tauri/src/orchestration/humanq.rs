//! The human-question registry (#946 slice Q1) — the durable record behind
//! `ask_human` / `list_questions` / `withdraw_question`.
//!
//! # Why the engine owns this, and not a liaison agent
//!
//! A blocking orchestrator question halts the whole fleet: while a CLI's own
//! interactive dialog is on screen that pane cannot take a delivery, so every
//! worker report queues behind it. One human-absent question is an overnight
//! outage. The fix is to make asking *asynchronous* — the orchestrator
//! registers a question, gets an id back immediately, and keeps orchestrating.
//!
//! The obvious shape is a dedicated liaison agent that holds the pending
//! question and relays it. That re-creates the incident one level up: an agent
//! pane is an LLM session, and it compacts, wedges and dies. So the
//! pending question is **engine state** — a per-group file, `questions.json`,
//! beside `tasks.json` — and any presenter (the webview inbox, a liaison pane,
//! a chat bridge) is a client of that record, never the record itself.
//!
//! # The trust boundary — the part to read before changing anything here
//!
//! **Every agent may ASK. No agent may ever ANSWER.**
//!
//! An answer settles a question the *human* was asked, and un-blocks the work
//! that was waiting on it. If an agent could produce one, the mechanism would
//! be a machine asking itself for permission — the same self-served-gate shape
//! CLAUDE.md constraint 9 refuses for install/security prompts, and it would
//! make the whole feature theatre.
//!
//! That is enforced structurally rather than by convention, in three layers:
//!
//! 1. **No answer tool exists.** `mcp.rs`'s `call_tool` is a closed match on
//!    tool names; none of its arms reaches [`super::OrchRegistry::answer_question`].
//!    An agent cannot call what has no name.
//!    `no_agent_token_can_answer_a_question_through_the_mcp_surface` dispatches
//!    every tool the surface offers and asserts the question still carries no
//!    answer afterwards — *no answer*, deliberately, rather than *still
//!    pending*: [`withdraw_question`](super::OrchRegistry::withdraw_question) is
//!    on that surface and legitimately settles a question as `withdrawn`, and
//!    the whole point is that taking your own question back is not the same
//!    power as deciding it. `the_mcp_surface_has_no_path_to_the_answer_entry_point`
//!    scans `mcp.rs`'s source so a future slice cannot wire one in quietly.
//! 2. **The source is a property of the entry point, never an argument.**
//!    [`AnswerSource`] is a closed enum whose variants are trusted surfaces,
//!    and `orch_question_answer` hard-codes [`AnswerSource::Webview`] rather
//!    than accepting a `source` string. There is no spelling of "answer as
//!    someone else", so there is nothing to validate and nothing to forge.
//!    **The closed SET is itself pinned**, not just the type's whereabouts:
//!    `the_mcp_surface_has_no_path_to_the_answer_entry_point` reads the variant
//!    list off this file's own declaration, so an `AnswerSource::Agent` added
//!    here — a legitimate home for the type, and therefore invisible to a
//!    "where may it be named" check — reddens a test. Every variant is a party
//!    empowered to settle a question the human was asked; that list is the
//!    boundary.
//! 3. **Provenance is durable.** Every settle and every refusal is audited
//!    (`question-answer`, `question-reject`) carrying the source tag, so
//!    "who answered this, and what was turned away" is reconstructable from
//!    the log rather than from memory.
//!
//! If you are adding a second answer surface (the #947 chat bridge is the
//! planned one), add an [`AnswerSource`] variant and a trusted entry point
//! that supplies it. Do **not** add a `source` parameter, and do not add an
//! MCP tool.
//!
//! # Dismissal — a second human power, deliberately not the same one (#2137)
//!
//! The human can also settle a question by saying it no longer matters:
//! [`Status::Dismissed`], through
//! [`dismiss_question`](super::OrchRegistry::dismiss_question) and its own
//! closed [`DismissSource`]. Everything above applies to it unchanged — no MCP
//! tool reaches it, the source is a property of the entry point, and both the
//! settle and every refusal are audited.
//!
//! What is NOT shared is the closed set. `DismissSource` is its own enum
//! rather than a variant of `AnswerSource`, because answering and dismissing
//! are different powers over the same row: an answer is a decision the fleet
//! acts on, a dismissal decides nothing and only releases a hold. One list
//! behind both would mean a surface trusted to do one silently acquired the
//! other. Two lists, two deliberate decisions.
//!
//! # Naming
//!
//! `Question*` is already taken in `screen.rs` and `questionhold.rs` by the pane detector that decides
//! whether a CLI is showing an interactive prompt (`QuestionMatch`,
//! `QuestionWitnessed`, …) — unrelated machinery. This module keeps its own
//! vocabulary behind the `humanq::` path (`humanq::Question`,
//! `humanq::Status`) so neither grep nor reader has to disambiguate.
