//! The guard on the E2E soak lane's lock-hold injector (#1603, plan #1600 §3
//! Phase 4.1).
//!
//! `orchestration::e2ehold` is the one piece of this repo that deliberately
//! makes the app misbehave — it holds a registry mutex for tens of seconds so
//! the soak spec can assert the app is still alive underneath. The claim that
//! makes that acceptable is "it cannot ship enabled", and a claim is a
//! deliverable: this file is what turns it into something a reviewer can
//! check instead of read.
//!
//! Four separate properties, because the claim rests on four separate things
//! and any one of them could rot on its own:
//!
//! 1. **Nothing that can hold a lock or sleep survives a release build.** A
//!    source scan over `e2ehold.rs` that classifies by *shape* (does this
//!    function's body contain a hazard?) rather than by name, per CLAUDE.md's
//!    source-scanning-guard convention — a rename must not step over it. The
//!    scan recognises a function DEFINITION at any visibility, modifier and
//!    indentation, and cross-checks that every hazard occurrence in the file
//!    landed inside one it enumerated: both of its floors count at the MATCH
//!    site, so they say the instrument ran and never that it saw every
//!    subject. An earlier version enumerated `fn ` and `pub fn ` only, which
//!    left an ungated `pub(crate) fn` holding a registry mutex invisible with
//!    both floors green (#1606 review B3).
//! 2. **That refusal is performed, not asserted.** Two tests splice a
//!    hazardous definition into the real source — one an ungated
//!    `pub(crate) fn`, one a hazard outside every function — and require the
//!    report to name it. Everything else here is an absence assertion, and an
//!    absence assertion passes just as well when the instrument cannot see
//!    the subject.
//! 3. **The release profile really does turn `debug_assertions` off.** Gate
//!    (1) is only worth anything while that holds, and it holds today by
//!    cargo's default rather than by anything written down — so a future
//!    `[profile.release] debug-assertions = true` (a plausible thing to add
//!    while chasing a release-only panic) would silently arm the injector in
//!    a shipped binary with nothing else red.
//! 4. **The runtime opt-in accepts exactly one value, and a malformed request
//!    is refused loudly.** Both are behaviours, not shapes, so both are
//!    tested by calling them. The second one matters for the same reason the
//!    spec keeps an `acquired_ms` breadcrumb: a hold that silently never
//!    happens looks, from the spec's side, exactly like the app passing the
//!    assertion it was supposed to fail.
