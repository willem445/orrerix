//! The orchestration **data model** — the closed capability classes, the deny
//! tiers they map to, the per-CLI capability table, and the pure functions that
//! read them (#888 slice A2 batch 4).
//!
//! Everything here is data plus `match`: no I/O, no registry state, no
//! `AppHandle`. It moved ahead of the `workflow` cluster on purpose. `workflow`
//! is the next batch, and it reaches for exactly these symbols — `CLI_CAPS` for
//! its knob remedies, `EFFORT_LEVELS`/`CONTEXT_VARIANTS` for its closed
//! vocabularies, `sanitize_model_opt` for a block's `model:`, and [`Role`] for a
//! block's `kind:`. Had they stayed behind, moving `workflow` would have pointed
//! the arrow back into `src-tauri`, which is the one thing this crate exists to
//! prevent. Batch 3's finding applies again: an edge into `mod.rs` is not an
//! edge into the registry, and a pure callee is cut by moving the callee.
//!
//! # What deliberately did NOT come with `Role`
//!
//! `Role::template()` and `Role::instructions_file()` were inherent methods on
//! this enum. Batch 4 turned both into free functions (`role_template`,
//! `role_instructions_file`) and left both in
//! `src-tauri/src/orchestration/mod.rs`, next to the `include_str!` templates
//! they load.
//!
//! An inherent impl has to live in the crate that defines the type, so keeping
//! them as methods would have dragged `templates/*.md` — and with them the
//! byte-golden fixture root `src-tauri/tests/fixtures/pre222/` that pins those
//! four files — into this crate as a side effect of a data move. Role templates
//! are product content governed by their own design notes and their own
//! re-bless procedure; relocating their fixture root silently, as a consequence
//! of a refactor, is a failure mode nothing catches. Rewriting the call sites
//! is the other option, and it is one the compiler checks exhaustively: every
//! missed site is a build error, on CI, before review. A mechanical failure the
//! compiler finds beats a silent one no test watches. Same question batch 2
//! asked of `GroupId`'s tripwire, answered the other way round: there, the
//! guard had to follow the type; here, the content must not.
//!
//! **Batch 5 split that pair, and the split is the sharper reading of the same
//! rule.** `role_template` stays: it loads the fixture-pinned bytes, so it is
//! the half the argument above is actually about. [`role_instructions_file`]
//! came across, because it loads nothing — it maps a class onto the file name
//! the *group directory* carries, and `workflow::Block::instructions_file`
//! calls it from inside this crate. Batch 4 kept them together on the ground
//! that "the name and the bytes are one mapping"; that pairing turned out to be
//! the weaker half of its own argument. What must not travel silently is
//! content and the procedure that blesses it, and a bare `"worker.md"` is
//! neither. The pin is unmoved either way: see this function's own doc comment
//! for the test that would redden.
//!
//! # Widened on the way in
//!
//! `Role::prefix`, `Role::as_str`, `default_model` and `sanitize_model_opt`
//! were `pub(crate)` in `src-tauri`. Their callers stayed there, so no
//! visibility narrower than `pub` still reaches them — the same conversion
//! batch 3 made for `notify::check_is_pending`/`check_is_failing`, and the same
//! question to ask of it: whether the item is one this crate is content to
//! expose, not merely whether it compiles. All four are total functions over a
//! closed enum or a `&str`, with no state and no invariant a caller could
//! violate by holding them. [`role_instructions_file`] joined them in batch 5
//! on the same terms and for the same reason — `pub` here so both `workflow`
//! and `mod.rs` can reach it.
//!
//! **What a `pub(crate) use` on the other side does and does not buy**, because
//! the convenient phrasing for this is wrong and was written twice before it
//! was caught. `orchestration` re-exports these `pub(crate)`, which governs the
//! FLAT spelling — `orchestration::default_model`,
//! `orchestration::role_instructions_file`, the ones every existing call site
//! uses — and nothing else. It does not narrow the item, because `mod.rs` also
//! re-exports this whole module publicly (`pub use loomux_engine::model::{self,
//! …}`), so every `pub` item here is reachable as `orchestration::model::…`
//! too. `role_instructions_file` was `pub(crate)` before batch 5 and is
//! publicly reachable by that path now. So the accurate claim is **"no existing
//! spelling widened"**, not "the public surface is unchanged".
//!
//! That reachability change is forced and harmless, which is why the answer is
//! to state it rather than to contort the re-export chasing a literal
//! "unchanged". Forced: the function has to be `pub` here for `src-tauri`'s
//! call sites to reach it at all, and `model::` was already a public re-export
//! before this batch. Harmless: `loomux-engine` is `publish = false` — an
//! internal workspace boundary, not a shipped library API — so "public" here
//! means reachable by a sibling crate in this repo, not a compatibility promise
//! to anyone outside it.
