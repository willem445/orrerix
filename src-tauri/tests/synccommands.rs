//! Every **synchronous** `#[tauri::command]` in the orchestration module either
//! cannot reach a tracked lock, or runs inside a command-boundary frame (#1702,
//! #1713 review B1).
//!
//! # Why this class needs a guard at all
//!
//! Tauri dispatches a non-`async` command by calling it **inline, on the
//! webview/GUI thread, inside the WebView2 COM callback's own stack frame**:
//! `tauri-macros`' `body_blocking` -> `run_invoke_handler` -> `ipc/protocol.rs`
//! -> `wry`'s webview2 backend -> `webview2-com-sys`'s
//! `unsafe extern "system" fn Invoke`. Traced through the vendored sources for
//! #1713 review B1: there is **no `catch_unwind` anywhere on that path** in
//! `tauri`, `tauri-runtime-wry`, `wry`, `webview2-com` or `webview2-com-sys`,
//! and that `Invoke` thunk is a plain `extern "system"` with no `-unwind` ABI.
//! An unwind reaching it hits Rust's abort-on-unwind shim and the **process
//! aborts**.
//!
//! #1702 made `lock_safe` refuse a re-entrant acquisition by unwinding. On
//! every other thread that is the improvement — the registry is released and
//! one caller pays. On this one it would kill the app. A `read_budget` frame is
//! what contains it: the frame's own `catch_unwind` catches the typed unwind
//! `budget::unwind_to_frame` throws, so the refusal becomes the command's
//! degraded value and never reaches the boundary.
//!
//! So this is a **frame-mandatory class**, and the eighth command added to it
//! is the one that would forget. That is what this scan is for. It does not
//! decide from a binding's NAME (CLAUDE.md's source-scanning-guard rule): the
//! population is every sync command, the verdict is structural, and the one
//! exemption is a signature property rather than a list of blessed names.
//!
//! # What it cannot see, stated
//!
//! - It scans `mod.rs` only. A sync command in another orchestration file is
//!   invisible; there are none today, and the population floor below would not
//!   notice if one appeared elsewhere.
//! - It reads the body TEXT between the signature and the next column-0 `}`, so
//!   it sees a wrapper mentioned anywhere in that body. The frame is what
//!   matters and the frame is installed at this boundary, so that is the right
//!   granularity — but a body that merely *names* a wrapper in a comment would
//!   satisfy it.
//! - `async` commands are out of scope by construction: Tauri spawns their
//!   bodies onto the async runtime rather than running them in the COM frame,
//!   so an unwind there is a task failure and not an abort.
