//! Substance pins for the **role prompts** — the text every loomux group's agents actually read
//! (`templates/{orchestrator,worker,reviewer,planner}.md`, rendered into the group's state dir).
//!
//! Prose is production code here: every sentence is executed literally by an agent, and a rule
//! that quietly disappears in a future edit fails silently and invisibly — the agent simply stops
//! doing it, and nobody finds out until a PR merges with its findings dropped or a red `main`
//! sits there all afternoon. These tests are the seatbelt: each load-bearing rule is pinned to
//! the text that carries it, so deleting it is a failing test that **names the rule it deleted**.
//!
//! Three things make a prose pin actually able to fail, and all three are the scar tissue of a
//! review that mutated the templates rather than reading the tests (#236):
//!
//! 1. **Whitespace-collapsed matching** ([`flat`]). These are hard-wrapped markdown files: a pin
//!    that fires when a paragraph is re-wrapped reports "you changed the rule" when no rule moved,
//!    and *that* red is what teaches people to bless a diff without reading it.
//! 2. **Region scoping** ([`section`]). Most load-bearing rules appear twice by design — once in
//!    the INVARIANTS digest (the rule) and once in the body (its procedure). A document-wide match
//!    is satisfied by either, so deleting the body's procedure leaves the pin green, rescued by
//!    the digest: the rule survives as a slogan with no instructions attached.
//! 3. **Uniqueness** ([`pinned`]). An anchor that occurs more than once inside the region it is
//!    asserted in cannot fail when the rule it names is deleted — some other occurrence rescues
//!    it. So that is a failing test *here*, rather than a defect found later by mutating prose.
//!
//! Every anchor below was mutation-verified: delete the markdown unit (list item or paragraph)
//! that carries the rule, and the owning test goes red.
