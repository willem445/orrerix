// Roster resolution (#222) — what the launcher tells the human a group will run,
// BEFORE it runs it. The consent surface for the advanced-orchestrator toggle, so
// what these tests defend is not "the code does what it does" but "the launcher
// cannot promise a roster the backend won't deliver".
//
// The four outcomes it has to get right, in rising order of how badly a wrong
// answer would burn someone:
//   toggle off        → the standard four roles; a workflow file, if any, is not read
//   on, no file       → a NO-OP, not an error (it is how you launch before writing one)
//   on, broken file   → a WARNING, not a blocker (the group still launches, standard)
//   on, valid file    → the declared blocks, personas and all
