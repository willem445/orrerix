// Pure, DOM-free core of the visibility policy for fixed-cadence polls
// (#743 S6). The DOM wiring lives in the views that own a poll — tabbar.ts,
// groupview.ts, auditview.ts, timelineview.ts — and everything that DECIDES
// anything is here so it is unit-testable under `node --test`, the same split
// as panethrottle.ts / refreshgate.ts.
//
// WHAT THIS IS FOR. `docs/design/performance.md` §3 INV-4: a frontend timer
// that drives IPC or rendering is visibility-aware or argued. The census
// (#743 plan part 2b §3) found nothing in `src/` that had ever read
// `document.hidden`, so a minimized window kept paying the tab strip's 4 s
// `groupSummary` + `groupUsage` sweep over every group-bound tab, forever, plus
// whatever panels were left open behind it — the group view's nine invokes
// every 2 s, an armed audit/timeline follow every 1.5 s. None of that feeds
// anything a human can see while the window is not on screen.
//
// PAUSE, NOT SKIP. The gate stops the underlying `setInterval` rather than
// letting it fire into a body that returns early. A tick that fires and
// discards still costs a timer wake and a callback on the one thread that also
// services input and paint (§1), and — the part that actually matters — an
// early return is a thing each caller has to remember to write, in the middle
// of a body that already has three other reasons to bail. Arming and disarming
// is a property of the timer, so it lives with the timer.
//
// THE RELEASE IS NOT THE EVENT (§2 P4, and the repo's standing rule that any
// suppression driven by a fallible signal needs a release that does not depend
// on that signal — #496/#513/#518). `visibilitychange` is a browser-owned
// notification: a listener that never fires leaves a poll suppressed forever,
// which for the group view means a panel that silently stops updating. So the
// gate does not trust the event to be the only way back. While a wanted poll is
// suppressed it runs a recheck ticker that READS the current visibility state
// (`HIDDEN_RECHECK_MS`) and resumes on what it reads, never on having been
// told. The recheck costs one property read per wake and issues no IPC, so a
// hidden window still makes zero data polls — which is the observable S6 is
// meant to produce.
//
// WHY THE CADENCE STAYS AT THE CALL SITE. The gate deliberately does not own
// the interval: each view keeps its own interval call, with its own cadence
// constant, and hands the gate three verbs. That keeps every shipped cadence a
// literal at the site that chose it, which is exactly what E2's timer manifest
// (`test/perfpolicy.test.ts`) scans for — a gate that swallowed the cadences
// into one file would make INV-4's enumeration blind in the act of satisfying
// it.
