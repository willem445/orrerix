// sizes across one composite — a pane last laid out full-width shrank to an
// illegible, sub-pixel smear (its background-colored rows collapsing into
// horizontal bars) next to an 80-col pane at readable size. The fix: ONE shared
// scale for the whole composite, so text is the same size everywhere.

 *  the composite uses the **median** of those fits, clamped to `[min, max]`.
 *
 *  Median (not min) is deliberately robust to an OUTLIER pane — one serialized
 *  at stale/oversized dims (e.g. last laid out full-width): rather than dragging
 *  the whole composite down to that pane's tiny fit (illegible for everyone), the
 *  composite renders at the typical scale and the outlier simply **crops** to its
 *  cell (cells are `overflow:hidden`) — crop, never squish. Panes that would fit
 *  larger letterbox instead. The `min` floor keeps text off the sub-pixel range
 *  where downscaled background runs smear into bars; below it, panes crop rather
 *  than shrink further. `max` (≤1) never enlarges past the source glyphs. Empty

// mints its OWN tab, regardless of how the setup pane it's replacing got
// there. That is candidate #1 from the issue — a group-creation path that
// owns tab placement rather than the ordinary split path that respects the
// target pane — confirmed by reading the call site, not the other candidate
// (no split-target is ever threaded through `openAgentPane`/`grid.openPane`
// today, so there was nothing to lose across the async round trip; it was
// simply never consulted).

 *  shortcuts) funnels through `openWelcomeIn`, and any of them splitting an

 *  submitted. The gesture picked a location; honour it — convert the setup
 *  pane in place instead of relocating the result to a new tab.
 *
 *  `"own-tab"`: the setup pane IS the tab's only pane (a fresh Ctrl+T tab, the
 *  initial boot tab, or a tab drained back to welcome after its last pane
 *  closed) — there is nothing to split into, so this keeps the pre-#478
