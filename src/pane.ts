   *  cannot move, and the cheaper check loses nothing.
   *
   *  Naming the input that is ASSUMED rather than proven, since this comment
   *  exists because its predecessor over-claimed: that argument holds only
   *  while `agent_id` is constant for the pane, which is a property of the

   *  previous agent's name. The blast radius is the chip's `title` tooltip and
   *  nothing else — no state, no delivery — which is why the cheap check still
   *  wins; if a rebind ever needs to repaint it, key on `(reason, detail)` like
   *  `setAttention` rather than reaching for a rebind hook here. Copy `setAttention`'s rule

   *  that `cd`s to `~/.ssh` gets a quiet folder chip rather than a rooted file
   *  browser. A human clicking the branch chip, or pressing Alt+G, is not that
   *  stream. It is the trusted local webview acting on a human gesture, and it
   *  declares.
   *
   *  **Called only from `toggleView`, and only on the `open` action.** It used
   *  to be called from each `toggleXView` *before* `toggleView` decided what the

   *  which direction, which views — are pinned in `test/embedtoggle.test.ts`.
   *
   *  Normally there is nothing new to declare: a pane's spawn cwd was declared
   *  by the launcher (or by restore), and the descendant rule already covers
   *  everything the shell `cd`s into below it. This matters exactly when the cwd
   *  has left every declared root — which is the case the gesture is for.
   *
   *  Fire-and-forget, and slice C owes it one look. The declaration is *issued*
   *  before the view opens, but two Tauri commands in flight are not ordered
   *  against each other, so once slice C root-scopes the view's own reads there
   *  is a race here in principle. Bounded rather than ignored: every one of
   *  these views re-reads on its own (a shell prompt, an external git change, a
   *  manual ↻), so losing that race costs one empty render, not the feature. If
   *  slice C wants it airtight, `toggleView` becomes `async` and awaits this —
   *  a change this helper is shaped to make one line.
   *
   *  Never for an SSH pane: its cwd names a directory on the REMOTE machine, and
   *  declaring that string here would declare whatever happens to sit at the
   *  same path locally. `onCwdReported` already refuses to act on an SSH pane's
