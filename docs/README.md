# Orrerix documentation site

The repository's ONE documentation root (#3315). Two things live here and only
one of them is published:

- **the user-facing site**, published to **GitHub Pages** at
  <https://willem445.github.io/orrerix/> — `index.md`, `getting-started.md`,
  `features/`, and the rest of the top level;
- **the internal notes** — `design/` (the design notes and ADRs `CLAUDE.md`
  points at) and `plans/` — which are **excluded from the Jekyll build** by
  `exclude:` in `_config.yml`, because they are written for contributors and
  agents rather than for users. `_config.yml` carries the argument, and the
  alternative it was weighed against.

So "add a page to the docs" and "write a design note" both land in this folder,
and the `exclude:` list is what separates them. A user-facing behaviour change
updates a page above; a non-obvious architecture decision gets a note in
`design/`.

> This `README.md` is a **contributor** note — it is excluded from the published
> site too. The reader-facing entry point is [`index.md`](index.md).

## How the site is built

This is a **GitHub-Pages-native Jekyll** site: checked-in Markdown plus one
`_config.yml`, and nothing else.

- **No repo-local toolchain — don't add one.** There is no `package.json`, no
  `Gemfile`, and no lockfile in `docs/`; the Jekyll runtime comes from the CI
  action (`actions/jekyll-build-pages`, which bundles the `github-pages` gem).
  A Node SSG here would add a dependency tree to keep patched. Node stays in CI
  for what needs it (the app's typecheck/build/tests); the docs deploy is a
  separate, self-contained workflow that pulls in nothing from the app
  toolchain.
- **The theme is a pinned remote theme.** `remote_theme:
  just-the-docs/just-the-docs@v0.12.0` gives a sidebar, search, and light/dark
  without vendoring anything. It's pinned to a release tag so an upstream change
  can't silently break a release-day publish; bumping it is a deliberate
  one-line edit.
- **The build only runs in CI/Pages** — no Ruby is assumed on a contributor's
  machine — so a broken `_config.yml` or a bad theme pin is caught by the
  workflow's **build job**, not locally. That's why the docs workflow runs a
  **build-only dry-run on PRs that touch `docs/`** (see below).

Page order is whatever each page's `nav_order` front matter says; read the front
matter rather than a listing here.

## How it's published

[`.github/workflows/docs.yml`](../.github/workflows/docs.yml) builds and deploys
via the official GitHub Pages Actions flow (`jekyll-build-pages` →
`upload-pages-artifact` → `deploy-pages`). `baseurl`/`url` are set here in
`_config.yml`, so the workflow deliberately omits `actions/configure-pages` —
that action queries the Pages API and 404s until Pages is enabled, which would
break the PR dry-run before the one-time setup below. It runs:

- **on release** — tag pushes matching `v*` (the same trigger as
  `release.yml`, which it deliberately does **not** modify), so the site
  refreshes with each release;
- **on `workflow_dispatch`** — a manual button for docs-only fixes between
  releases;
- **on pull requests that touch a PUBLISHED page under `docs/`** — a
  **build-only dry-run** (the deploy job is skipped) so a broken config is
  caught before it ships. `design/` and `plans/` are negated in that workflow's
  `paths:` filter, because `_config.yml` excludes them from the build and an
  edit to one cannot change a published byte — so a design-note-only PR runs no
  dry-run, deliberately. The app's regular CI (`ci.yml`) does **not** build the
  docs either, so PR CI on code changes stays fast.

### One-time human setup (required once, can't be automated here)

GitHub Pages must be told to take its content from **GitHub Actions** rather than
a branch:

> **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source → "GitHub Actions".**

Until that's set, `deploy-pages` has nowhere to publish. This is a repo setting an
agent/workflow can't flip — do it once and every subsequent release publishes
automatically.

## Editing

- Add a page: create `foo.md` with front matter (`title`, `layout: default`,
  `nav_order`; add `parent: Features` for a feature sub-page). Keep `nav_order`
  values sane so the sidebar orders correctly.
- Cross-page links use **relative paths with `.html`** (e.g.
  `[git view](features/git-view.html)`) — that's what every existing page uses
  and what Jekyll + `baseurl` resolve on the published `/orrerix/` site
  (extensionless paths do not route on GitHub Pages' static hosting).
- **Honesty rule:** document only what ships on `main`. Verify every flag,
  shortcut, and behavior against the code/README before writing it. No invented
  features; no fake screenshots.

## Local preview (optional)

You don't need this — the CI build is authoritative — but if you have Ruby and
want a local preview:

```sh
cd docs
gem install bundler jekyll
# minimal Gemfile is not committed; install the github-pages gem to match CI:
gem install github-pages
jekyll serve
```

(Kept out of the committed toolchain on purpose — see "How the site is built".)
