// Pure, DOM-free geometry for the pane's embed-panel dividers (#361): up to
// three views — one each on the left, right, and bottom edges of the
// terminal — rendered as real flex siblings instead of floating over it. No
// DOM imports, so it's unit-testable under `node --test` (mirrors layout.ts
// / overlaysize.ts).
//
// This is deliberately modeled on grid.ts's own split-divider math (the
// inline mousemove handler in Pane's private `makeDivider`): before/after
// sizes and flex-grow weights, a pixel delta clamped so neither side can be
// dragged below its floor, then redistributed proportionally so the pair's
// total flex-grow is preserved. Reusing that exact shape is the point — an
// embedded panel resizes the terminal exactly the way a grid split already
// does (see docs/design/embedded-panels.md for why that's the legitimate
// side of the PTY-resize line), so each of the three dividers should feel
// identical to a grid split's, not invent a second discipline.
//
// THREE dividers, ONE function. `embedDragGrow` only ever reasons about a
// generic "before"/"after" pair — which pair it's given (left-slot | term,
// term | right-slot, or the row-as-a-whole | bottom-slot) is a `pane.ts`
// wiring decision, not something this module needs to know. That is also
// why there is no "compose the floor across nested regions" function here:
// with a FLAT 5-child row (left-slot, left-divider, term, right-divider,
// right-slot) each divider only ever touches its own two immediate
// neighbors — exactly grid.ts's own N-way-split convention (a divider
// trades space with its immediate before/after only, never reaching past
// them) — so no divider's clamp needs to know whether the OTHER side is
// even occupied.

// Deliberately no cross-module import (every other pure, node:test-covered
// module in this codebase — layout.ts, overlaysize.ts, spawnexpiry.ts,
// taskboard.ts — is self-contained): tsc's build forbids the explicit `.ts`
// extension an intra-src import would need for `node --test` to resolve it
// directly (TS5097), so a bare specifier here would work for one runner and
// not the other. `EMBED_MIN_TERM_PX`/`EMBED_MIN_PANEL_PX` below intentionally
// mirror overlaysize.ts's `TERM_RESERVE_H`/`OVERLAY_MIN_H` — same reasoning
// (a visible terminal strip; the panel's own header/list/footer chrome
// doesn't clip) — duplicated rather than shared.
