// The launcher's orchestrator-mode CLI catalog: which agent CLIs a group can be
// launched on, the curated model ids each one suggests, and the per-role default.
//
// DOM-free and I/O-free so `test/orchclis.test.ts` can pin it directly — it used
// to be a `const` inside launcher.ts, where the one thing worth testing about it
// (that a role's default is a model the picker actually offers, and that loomux
// never quietly pins a model the human didn't ask for) could not be.
//
// **This is a SUGGESTION list, not a capability claim.** Membership here says
// "the launcher can start a group on this CLI"; what a CLI can *do* is the
// backend's to state (`CLI_CAPS` / `cli_can_host`, and `agent_cli_knobs` for the
// knobs). The model lists are shortcuts for the ids this repo's issues actually
// target — the picker merges whatever the CLI's own `--help` reports and always
// keeps a `custom…` entry, so a missing id costs a human one line of typing, and
// a stale id in a hardcoded table would cost them a failed spawn (#329).
//
// That "shortcut" sizing holds for every row whose CLI can be asked something.
// It does NOT hold for copilot, whose row is a full catalog because nothing on
// the machine will answer for it — see the row itself for why, and for what
// retires it (#1020).
//
// Every id here is one PATH probe (`probe_agent_cli`) away from being refused at
// submit: the `id` IS the program name the launcher probes, which is why
// `orchclis.test.ts` pins it against `AGENTS`.
