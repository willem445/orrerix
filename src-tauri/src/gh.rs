//! GitHub issue integration for the per-pane issues view. Everything shells out
//! to the authenticated `gh` CLI — mirroring how `git.rs` shells out to `git`
//! — so loomux stores no token, OAuth, or secret and inherits the user's
//! existing `gh auth login`.
//!
//! Trust boundary (CLAUDE.md constraint 6): `repo` is resolved backend-side
//! from the pane's cwd (via `git::git_repo_root`) and used only as the working
//! directory; `gh` infers the GitHub repository from that checkout's remote —
//! no frontend-supplied repo string ever reaches a `--repo` flag. Labels that
//! can be written are gated by a fixed allow-list, so a create/label call can
//! never attach an arbitrary label even though the webview is trusted.
//!
//! **The label vocabulary is scoped to a GROUP where the caller has one**
//! (#2663). Two commands here take an optional `group`, and the pane that owns
//! the issues view supplies its own (`orchGroupId`) when it is an orchestration
//! pane. The id is a `GroupId` before it is used — it never becomes a path here,
//! but the type is what makes `guardrails_of` unable to take a raw string. A
//! group's spelling comes from `guardrails.intake.hold`, the field the lifecycle
//! panel, the intake poller and the contract prose already read, and it is
//! re-checked against `workflow::usable_intake_label` before it can reach an
//! argv — see [`hold_label`].
//!
//! Like `git.rs`, spawns are arg-vectors (shell injection is impossible) and
//! `gh` output is decoded lossily. The `--json` field set is pinned rather than
//! parsing human output, so `gh` cosmetic changes don't break parsing.

/// **Without a group — the repo's `default` workflow**, through the #1689 pair
/// at `Guardrails::default()` (whose `workflow` name IS `default`), which is the

/// can be read as an option). Note the two are different claims: the alphabet
/// alone would have permitted `--force`, because `-` is in it.
///
/// **And the guarantee is about every path that reaches here** (#2663). A value
/// out of a workflow file met `parse_workflow`, so the sanitizer was always in
/// front of it. A group's `guardrails.intake.hold` is the path that did NOT:
/// `gh.rs` now reads group state, and a hand-edited `group.json` never met the
/// parser. An earlier version of this paragraph rested on "`gh.rs` does not read

/// which is the parser's own rule and refuses a leading `-` on top of the
