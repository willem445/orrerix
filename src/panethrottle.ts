// Pure, DOM-free core of the unfocused-pane flush policy (#720). The DOM
// wiring lives in pane.ts (`handleOutput`/`flushOutput`); everything that
// DECIDES anything is here so it is unit-testable under `node --test`, the
// same split as panefit.ts / panerename.ts.
//
// What this is for, and what it is NOT for
// ----------------------------------------
// #714 already bounded the *event* rate: the backend coalesces a pane's PTY
// output into at most one `pty-output` per 60 Hz frame, so the per-event costs
// (a GUI-thread script compilation, one `atob`, one decode loop) are already
// amortized and are NOT what this addresses. What #714 could not touch is what
// each surviving event costs INSIDE xterm, per pane, per frame:
//
//   - PARSE — `Terminal.write` appends to xterm's `WriteBuffer`, which parses
//     in 12 ms slices and yields between them
//     (node_modules/@xterm/xterm/src/common/input/WriteBuffer.ts,
//     `WRITE_TIMEOUT_MS`). Cost is a function of BYTES.
//   - RENDER — every parsed row-range change calls `RenderService.refreshRows`,
//     which funnels into `RenderDebouncer.refresh` — one `requestAnimationFrame`
//     per batch (browser/RenderDebouncer.ts). Cost is a function of DIRTY CELLS
//     and is paid once per frame in which the pane was written to at all.
//
// Throttling moves NO parse work: the same bytes still reach xterm and are
// still parsed. What it removes is RENDER PASSES — a pane written to once per
// 100 ms renders ~6× fewer times than one written to every frame, because
// `RenderDebouncer` coalesces everything inside one frame into a single
// `renderRows` call and nothing coalesces ACROSS frames. That is the entire
// mechanism, and it is why this only pays on panes whose render share is
// non-trivial. See docs/design/pane-render-throttle.md.
//
// xterm already stops rendering a pane that is not on screen at all:
// `RenderService` observes the screen element with an `IntersectionObserver`
// and sets `_isPaused` when it stops intersecting (browser/services/
// RenderService.ts, `_handleIntersectionChange`), which covers a hidden
// project tab, a maximized-behind sibling, and a docked pane. The gap this
// closes is the one xterm cannot see: a pane that IS on screen and IS being
// rendered, in a grid of six, that the human is not reading.
//
// Data loss is not on the table. Deferring means holding the arrived chunks in
// a list and writing them, in order, on the next flush — `Terminal.write`'s own
// queue does the same thing one layer down. Nothing is dropped, coalesced, or
// reordered; only the moment of the `write` call moves.
