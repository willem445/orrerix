# The right-side dock: git, files and editor, following the active pane (#1020 item 6)

> The user-facing page for the side dock is [`docs/features/side-dock.md`](../features/side-dock.md) —
> what it does. This note is the *why*.

Status: implemented (main). Issues: #1020 item 6 (the ask this builds), #934
(the original ORCA-sidebar direction), #1018 (the PR it landed in), #1150 (the
beta1 feedback that made it displace the grid rather than cover it).

The ask, from the human's live demo of #1018: *"right sidebar hosting the
built-in git / file-explorer / file-editor, optionally open, auto-loaded to the
active pane's current directory."* #934 says the same thing earlier and adds the
reference — ORCA's right sidebar, a strip of view-switch buttons over one docked
panel — plus one requirement worth quoting because it shapes the whole design:
*"the sidebar auto-updates to the directory of whichever pane is currently
highlighted/focused."*

## The one structural decision, and it was reversed on purpose (#1150)

**The dock is a flex sibling of `#grid-area`. Opening it shrinks the grid and
the open panes autosize to share the row; closing it gives the column back.**

It shipped as the exact opposite — `position: absolute` inside `#workspace`,
out of flow, occluding panes precisely so that no code path here could reach a
terminal — and the reversal is the whole of #1150. It is worth writing down both
halves, because the first one was right when it was written and the second one
is right now, and the difference between them is not a change of mind.

### What the overlay bought, and why it stopped being worth it

The overlay's argument was a cost argument. `#sessions` — the left session
browser, an in-flow flex sibling at `width: 344px` with a `0.24s` width
transition — shrinks the grid when it opens, which refits every terminal and
resizes every ConPTY behind them, and that used to happen **on every frame of
the animation**: ~15 xterm reflows plus 15 `ResizePseudoConsole` calls per pane
per toggle, ~90 with six panes open. Against that, an out-of-flow panel paying
*zero* was not a close call.

Two things changed.

**#1149 removed the multiplier.** The coalescing now lives in the fit debounce
itself (`src/resizeburst.ts`), so a whole animated burst collapses into **one**
fit per pane at the settled geometry. The displacing panel's cost went from
~15 per pane per toggle to 1. That is not a rounding difference; it is the
difference between a per-frame storm and a discrete event.

**The human used it and asked for the other trade** (#1150, beta1 feedback:
*"the side dock's button should autosize the OPEN panes the way the Sessions UI
does, not the current hover behavior"*). The overlay's stated cost — "an open
dock covers the right-hand panes" — was mitigated by defaulting closed and by
being one click from open. Neither mitigation helps the person who wants it
**open**, which is the person who asked: for them the dock was permanently
covering the panes they were watching, and "you can close it" is not an answer
to "I want to see both".

### Why this does not break the constraint it looks like it breaks

CLAUDE.md constraint 1 says a UI feature must not resize the PTY, and the thing
it exists to prevent is *continuous, chrome-driven* resizing — the repaint tax
`docs/design/xterm-resize-reflow.md` documents, where a ConPTY resize makes the
Win10 inbox conhost repaint the screen and TUIs duplicate frames into scrollback.
The repo already distinguishes that from a **discrete, user-initiated** geometry
change: `docs/design/embedded-panels.md` builds dividers that resize the PTY
deliberately, on the argument that docking a panel *inside* a pane is a gesture
the human made, not a tax the chrome levies.

The dock's two triggers fall on opposite sides of exactly that line, and only
one of them moved:

- **Opening or closing the dock** is a click. One coalesced resize per open
  pane, at the settled geometry, on a gesture whose entire purpose is to change
  how much room the terminals get. That is the discrete category, and it is now
  what happens.
- **Following the active pane** — the frequent, passive trigger, firing on every
  focus change, every Alt+arrow step, every project-tab switch — still resizes
  **nothing at all**. It re-points a panel inside a column whose width did not
  move. This was the trigger the original note called out as "passive, frequent,
  and exactly the trigger the constraint targets", and it remains free.

So the rule is unchanged and the dock's membership in it changed. What is *not*
licensed by this: the overlay-class features stay overlays (the per-pane git
view, the task board, the audit viewer, badges, the compose strip), and nothing
here permits a *passive* signal to resize a terminal.

### The residual costs, stated rather than hidden

- **One xterm reflow + one ConPTY resize per open pane per toggle.** The floor
  for anything that displaces the grid. `test/resizeburst.test.ts` measures it
  as exactly one, through the same simulator #1149 used for `#sessions`.
- **The per-frame *layout* work of the 240 ms animation**, which #1149 did not
  remove and this does not either. On a *toggle* the panel's own contents are
  lifted out of it (below), so what re-lays-out each frame is the grid and not a
  git graph — but that exemption is the toggle's, not a property of the panel:
  a *room* change re-lays-out the contents too (#1203, below).
- **The grip drag now has terminals on the other side of it** (below).
- **A narrow window with both side panels open squeezes the dock**, deliberately,
  rather than squeezing the grid — down to the point where a readable dock no
  longer fits beside the grid's reserve, below which it is not shown at all
  (below).

### The mechanism, and the two things that are easy to get wrong

**Closed is a zero-width column, not `display: none`.** `el.hidden` is what the
overlay used, and it is the obvious way to hide a panel — but `display: none`
gives the column back in one jump, with no transition. No transition means no
burst, which means nothing for the coalescer to coalesce and no autosize for the
human to watch; it also means the panes snap, which is the "feel" half of what
#1150 asked for. `dockBoxes` (`sidedockmodel.ts`) returns `columnPx: 0` for a
closed dock, and `test/sidedockmodel.test.ts` pins both that and the absence of
`this.el.hidden =` in the DOM half, because `display: none` would hide the dock
perfectly well and break the feature silently.

**A closed column is only *visually* empty, so it is `inert`.** `display: none`
took the dock out of the tab order and out of a screen reader's traversal for
free. A zero-width column with `overflow: hidden` does not: without the `inert`
+ `aria-hidden` that `applyOpenState` sets, a closed dock's tab buttons and its
editor's buffer would still be focusable and still announced. Applied at the
moment of the toggle rather than on `transitionend` — a dismissed panel should
stop taking input immediately, and there is nothing to schedule or clean up.

**The contents do not animate on a toggle; only the column does.**
`.sidedock-inner` is absolutely positioned at a fixed width (`contentPx`, set
from the same `dockBoxes` call as the column's own width, so the two cannot
disagree) and the column clips it. Otherwise every frame of the slide would
re-lay-out a git graph or a file tree at an intermediate width — cheap for the
terminals, expensive for the panel. `.sessions-inner` is the same device for the
same reason; anchored right instead of left, so the collapse wipes from the grid
side.

**The boundary of that guarantee, because it is narrower than it reads.** The
width is fixed *per toggle*, not fixed absolutely: when the ROOM moves, the
panel is re-laid-out to follow it, which is exactly what stops the cropping the
next section is about. So a room that moves over time — `#sessions` animating
its own 240 ms slide — does put the panel's contents back into an animation, at
every intermediate width. You cannot have both: following the room is what makes
a squeezed dock narrow instead of cropped, and following it *smoothly* is what
puts the layout work back. That residual is open as **#1203**, with the
measurement left to the live pass rather than guessed at here.

That fixed width is derived from the room, not from the preference alone
(`clampDockWidth(width, room)`), so a column the flex row squeezed gets a panel
laid out FOR that width rather than a cropped slice of a wider one. An earlier
revision of this section recorded the cropping as an accepted residual; a
reviewer of #1189 was right that it is not one, and the next section is what
replaced it.

### The floor: readable, or absent — never a sliver

The fixed-width panel above has a consequence that only shows up at the narrow
end, and a reviewer of #1189 found it before the human did. `#sessions` takes
344px of the row, so the dock and the grid share `workspace - 344`; the grid
keeps 240 of that; the dock gets the rest. Below a **864px window** — a
half-screen window on a 1366 laptop, not some pathological minimum — the rest is
less than `DOCK_MIN_W`, and a panel laid out for 420px was being *cropped* into
it. At the app's own 640px minimum that is a 56px strip of a 420px panel, which
does not read as "narrow", it reads as broken.

Two things fix it, and they are different fixes:

**The panel follows the room down.** `contentPx` is `clampDockWidth(width,
room)`, so a squeezed column gets a panel laid out *for* that width rather than
a slice of a wider one. The human's own preference is an input here and is never
written back, so widening the window restores it exactly.

**Below the room a readable dock needs, it takes no column at all.**
`dockBoxes` returns `starved` when `room - reserve < DOCK_MIN_W`, and a starved
dock renders as a zero-width column — the same rendering as a closed one, and
inert for the same reason. This is the honest end of the trade the section above
describes: the grid keeps its reserve, the dock is what yields, and yielding now
has a point at which it stops being a strip of cropped chrome and becomes
nothing at all.

**`open` is not touched by any of it.** Starving is a rendering verdict, not a
close: the dock comes back on its own, in the state the human left it, as soon
as the room returns. What makes that automatic is a `ResizeObserver` on
`#grid-area` — the one piece of JS that reacts to the room, and worth justifying
because an earlier revision of this note refused exactly that ("a JS re-clamp
would mean a resize handler running next to the one subsystem this whole note
exists to keep away from the grid"). Three things make it different:

- it fires on the row's geometry, so it catches `#sessions` opening — which is
  not a window resize and produces no `resize` event at all;
- it **cannot oscillate**, and that is a property rather than a hope: the room
  it measures is `grid + dock`, which is invariant to how wide it makes the
  dock, so a write produces at most one more delivery that measures the same
  room and returns without writing;
- the expensive half — the collapse class, `inert`, `aria-hidden`, the toggle
  button — runs only when the starve verdict actually flips. A window drag that
  never crosses 864px costs two style writes per frame.

**What that last sentence does NOT claim, since an earlier revision of it did.**
It said the geometry change "is coalesced by `resizeburst.ts` like every other
one". It is coalesced — but the ceiling (`FIT_MAX_WAIT_MS`, 400 ms) is sized for
ONE 240 ms transition plus a window, and a room-driven write re-targets
`.sidedock`'s own 240 ms ease rather than suppressing it, the way the grip drag
does via `.sidedock.resizing`. Chain the two — `#sessions` sliding for 240 ms,
the dock's re-targeted ease running on past it — and the composite burst can
outlast the ceiling, taking one mid-slide fit per pane before the settled one.

The band is narrow and worth stating rather than rounding off: `columnPx` only
moves at all when `room - 240 < width`, so a workspace over ~1004px with the
session browser open never enters it, and above that the observer computes the
same boxes and writes the same value, which starts no transition. Inside the
band the cost is bounded at one extra resize per pane, on a gesture that already
resizes every PTY.

It is **#1203**, deferred deliberately: the whole chain is a claim about how CSS
transitions re-target under repeated JS writes, which nothing in this repo's
test rig can execute, and the cheapest fix — suppressing the transition on the
room-driven write, the treatment the drag already gets — changes animation
behaviour on a path no test here can exercise. `test/resizeburst.test.ts` cannot
see it either: it checks each panel's own transition against the ceiling in
isolation, so a composite burst is invisible to it. That is a gap in the guard as
much as in the behaviour, and it is named here rather than left for the next
reader to rediscover.

**The toggle button says so.** A dock that cannot be shown would otherwise make
the top-bar control appear dead — click, nothing, click, nothing. `SideDockHost`
gained `setToggleAvailability`, so the button disables itself and names both ways
out: close the session browser, or widen the window. A control that explains why
it cannot help is the difference between a constraint and a bug.

### Why not the per-pane embed engine, which already docks things to a right edge

`docs/design/embedded-panels.md` builds exactly that — up to three views docked
left/right/bottom **inside one pane**, with real dividers that **do** resize the
PTY, deliberately, on the argument that docking is a discrete user-initiated
split rather than chrome tax. It is a good mechanism and it is not this one.
Two differences, either of which is decisive:

- **Scope.** An embed belongs to one pane and dies with it. The thing asked for
  here is a property of the *app*: one panel that keeps showing one folder while
  the human clicks through four panes across three project tabs, and that
  survives the pane it happens to be following being closed.
- **Trigger.** An embed's resize is paid for by an explicit "put this here"
  gesture. The dock re-points itself every time the active pane changes — which
  is passive, frequent, and exactly the trigger the constraint targets. A dock
  built on the embed engine would resize terminals on every focus change, which
  is the one thing this feature must never do.

They coexist without interacting: the dock builds its own view instances, and a
pane's Alt+G / Alt+F overlays and embed slots are untouched.

## Following the active pane

Two triggers, one debounced pull, one decision:

- **`Grid.setActive`** gained an `onActive` callback, threaded through
  `Workspace` to `main.ts`. It is hung off `setActive` rather than
  `PaneEvents.onFocus` because focus is only one of the ways the active pane
  moves — closing a pane and inheriting its neighbour, finishing a drag,
  `moveFocus`, opening a pane and toggling maximize all reach `setActive`
  directly, and a dock wired to focus alone would sit on a stale folder after
  every one of them. It fires inside the existing same-pane early return, so
  re-focusing the pane you are already on stays free. **Every workspace has a
  grid and therefore gets this callback, so the handler is gated on
  `followsPaneChange(w.id, tabs.activeTabId)`** — only the foreground tab's
  pane changes may move the dock (below).
- **An active-tab change**, because switching *project tabs* changes the active
  pane with no grid's `setActive` firing at all: `applyActive` focuses the
  incoming tab's already-active pane, and `setActive` early-returns on it.
  Without this second trigger the dock keeps showing the previous tab's repo —
  plainly broken, and invisible until you have two tabs open. There is no
  active-tab event to subscribe to, only the tab-**set** listener
  `tabs.onChange`, so the dock filters it through `isActiveTabChange` (below);
  subscribing to it raw is a defect, not a shortcut.

Both funnel into one trailing-edge debounce (250ms). A human walking the grid
with Alt+arrow fires `setActive` per keystroke, and only where they stop
matters. Both also **pull** the active pane's cwd rather than trusting the pane
the event fired for, so the dock can never hold a stale snapshot of a value that
moves.

**That pull is why the gating matters, not a substitute for it.** An earlier
revision reasoned the opposite way — the dock reads the active pane itself, so
surely it does not matter which workspace's event woke it — and that is exactly
backwards. Reading the *right* pane at the *wrong moment* is the entire defect:
the cwd is live, so any uncaused wake-up can adopt a directory change the human
made long ago. Both gates below exist because a follow's *timing* is as
load-bearing as its *target*.

The decision itself is `decideFollow` (`sidedockmodel.ts`), and it carries two
rules worth naming:

**A pane with no local cwd never blanks the dock.** An SSH pane reports no local
directory at all — `Pane.onCwdReported` refuses OSC 7 outright for one, because
the path names a folder on the *far* end — and a welcome pane has none yet.
Clicking one of those is not a request to empty the sidebar, so the dock keeps
the last real root it had.

**A closed dock does nothing at all** — not even bookkeeping. `decideFollow`
returns `none` outright, `followActivePane` arms no timer, and no view is
constructed, refreshed or measured. It deliberately keeps **no pending root**:
opening the dock runs the same decision against the *live* cwd, which is
strictly more accurate than replaying a root that was current several minutes
ago.

An earlier revision did park a root, and it was wrong twice over: it recorded
the root on the *closed* call, so the reopen saw `dockRoot === paneCwd` and
returned `none` — the redemption actually happened as a side effect of
`syncActiveView` building from the already-set field — and the `adopt` its own
test witnessed was therefore a state the implementation could never reach (#1097
rev-767 N3). Dropping `park` makes every state this function can return
reachable from the real flow.

### The trigger is the whole correctness argument

A follow re-reads the active pane's **live** cwd. That is right for the two
signals above and wrong for anything else, because the cwd moves continuously
(OSC 7 rewrites it on every prompt) while those signals do not.

This is exactly where the first revision was broken (#1097 rev-767 B1). It
subscribed to `tabs.onChange` directly — which is a tab-**set** listener, not an
active-tab one: `emit()` also fires from `renameTab`, `setColor`, `moveTab`,
`closeTab`, `setTabAttention` (every time a background agent's attention flips)
and `touch()` (orch-channel traffic). So a `cd` the human typed and that was
correctly ignored at the time would be silently adopted **later**, at whatever
unrelated moment some other tab's chip happened to change: the file explorer
rebuilt out from under them, a clean editor file closed, and *whether it
happened at all* depended on background activity. Nondeterministic following is
worse than either pure choice.

`isActiveTabChange(prev, next)` is the fix and it is pinned in
`test/sidedockmodel.test.ts`: the dock compares tab ids rather than trusting the
event, and every other emit source leaves the id alone.

**There were two doors onto that defect, and the first fix closed only one.**
The other is `Grid.setActive`'s own callback, which is wired **per workspace** —
every project tab has a grid, so every project tab gets one. A *background* tab
opening or closing a pane (an agent finishing, a delegate spawning, a group
resuming) calls `setActive` on the survivor, and an ungated handler would then
re-read the *foreground* pane's live cwd and adopt a stale `cd` — the identical
user-visible failure, arriving through a different event, and equally dependent
on whether some other tab's agent happened to be busy.

`followsPaneChange(workspaceId, activeTabId)` closes it, and the `Workspace` is
already passed to the callback, so the gate is one comparison. Both predicates
are pinned by mutation: restoring either defect reddens the suite.

The general rule, worth stating once because it is what both fixes have in
common: **a follow re-reads a value that moves, so every signal that can fire
one has to be justified — reading the right pane is not the same as reading it
at a moment the human caused.**

### What is *not* followed: a `cd` on its own

The dock re-reads the active pane's folder **only when the active pane or the
active tab changes**. Typing `cd ../other-repo` in the focused terminal does not
move it; nothing else does either, until you click somewhere.

The precise consequence, stated because it is the honest version of "does not
follow a `cd`": if you `cd` in pane A, click pane B, then click back to pane A,
the dock lands on A's *new* folder — the cwd is read fresh at the moment of a
signal, never snapshotted at spawn. That is deterministic and human-caused,
which is the property that matters; what the dock refuses is moving at a moment
nobody asked for.

Following a `cd` *as it happens* is the brief's own boundary (`Grid.setActive`
is named as the trigger) and #934's wording ("whichever pane is currently
highlighted/focused"), and it is left where it is rather than quietly widened.
It is also not free to add: there is no event for a cwd change today —
`Pane.onCwdReported` assigns `cwdRaw` and calls a 500ms-throttled
`signalDirRefresh` — so following it means a new pane event and a second
throttle interacting with this one. Worth doing if the human asks at demo; not
worth smuggling in here.

## Hosting the three views, and the one thing that made it interesting

All three are already host-parameterized, and all three have the same shape:
`new XView(host)` → append `view.el` → `view.show()` → `view.dispose()`. The
root is **pulled** through a `getCwd()`/`getRoot()` callback. `GitView` and
`FileEditView` are constructed with `embedded: true`, which drops their own ✕
and Escape-to-close binding: the dock owns closing, and a second close
affordance inside a panel that already has one in its header is how the #361
demo found a dead empty rectangle.

**None of the three exposes a public setter for its root.** `GitView` and
`FileExplorerView` re-read the callback on their next refresh;
`FileEditView` latches the root on its first `show()` and never re-reads it.
Only one operation is correct for all three, so `decideViewSync` uses it
uniformly: **dispose and reconstruct**. That is also the only thing that drops
the caches a re-root would otherwise strand — `FileExplorerView` invalidates its
go-to-file index and content hashes on its own picker path only, so a view
re-rooted any other way would answer Go-to-file from the previous repo.

**And that is what makes the editor a design problem rather than a third case.**
Reconstructing a `FileEditView` throws its buffer away. Doing so because the
human clicked a different *pane* would destroy work they never agreed to lose,
which is exactly the rule #219 exists to state. So:

- a dirty editor returns **`hold`**: it stops following, keeps its file, and
  says so in a notice naming the folder it is still showing;
- it resumes on the next sync after it goes clean — saving or discarding both
  reach that — which is why the dock re-asks `decideViewSync` on **every tab
  activation** and not only when the root moves;
- **only the active tab's view is ever synced.** An inactive tab's view is left
  exactly as it was, which is what makes a hidden dirty editor safe and what
  stops a root change from rebuilding three views nobody is looking at. Each
  catches up when its tab is next selected.
- **closing the dock disposes nothing.** Closing is hiding: it must not destroy
  the editor's buffer, and it should not throw away a loaded git log either.

### Liveness: the git tab refreshes, the other two do not

A view built once and only reparented is a **snapshot**, and for git that reads
as a bug: commit in the very pane the dock is following, and the graph would
still show the repo as of whenever the tab was built (#1097 rev-767 N2).

So `Hosted` carries an optional `refresh()`, called when the active tab is
selected, when the dock opens, and on any follow signal that resolves to `none`
(same folder — the "clicked back after committing" case). Only git implements
it, via `GitView.notifyPrompt()`: the same throttled (500ms) call `Pane` already
drives from OSC 7 for its own instance, and a no-op unless the view is visible,
so a closed dock still costs nothing.

The explorer and the editor deliberately have **no** `refresh`. For them a
reload means re-navigating to the root or rebuilding the tree, which throws away
the human's place in it — a destructive operation that belongs behind their own
explicit refresh affordances, not on a signal they did not ask for. The
asymmetry is the point: a refresh is only free where it is free.

### The dock's editor is the one buffer holder outside every pane

The app-quit guard sweeps tabs, then panes (`main.ts`'s `unsavedBuffers`). The
dock's editor is in neither, so the sweep cannot reach it, and a quit that
misses a holder silently destroys it. `SideDock.bufferReport()` is concatenated
into that sweep deliberately, and `DirtyHost` gained a fourth value,
`"sidedock"`, so the confirm can say where to go look. Its line does **not**
name a pane — inventing one would point the human at a place they cannot go —
and instead carries the folder the dock was pointed at, which is the
disambiguator a tab name provides for every other line.

The other #219 paths need nothing: pane-kill and tab-close route through
`Pane.unsavedHolder()`, and the dock is not a pane's holder, so neither can
destroy its buffer in the first place.

### A quirk inherited, checked rather than assumed

`GitView`'s sub-divider sizes (`loomux.gitview.graphW`, `loomux.gitview.changesH`)
are **global** localStorage keys, shared by every instance — so the dock is now
a third consumer alongside a pane's overlay and a git content pane. This is
benign, and it was verified rather than hoped: `relayout()` re-applies the
*stored* value clamped to the live container with `persist: false`, so hosting a
git view in a 420px dock never writes the clamped-down width back. Only a real
divider drag persists. A wide pane's preference survives the dock, and vice
versa.

## Persistence

One localStorage key, `loomux.sidedock`, holding `{open, tab, width}` — the
`loomux.*` UI-chrome convention `agents.ts`, `editor.ts` and `gitlayout.ts`
already use, not the backend settings file, which is for durable app/session
config.

`decodeDockPrefs` is total and **field-wise lenient**: a malformed `tab` costs
the human their tab choice and nothing else, while `open` and `width` survive.
That is `tabstore.decodePane`'s leniency applied at a smaller scale, for the
same reason — record-wise rejection silently discards a whole preference on the
next boot after a stray hand-edit or a version that wrote one extra field.

**A persisted width is bounded on the way in to `[DOCK_MIN_W, DOCK_MAX_W]` and
no further** — `decodeDockPrefs` has no live window width, so it cannot apply
the workspace reserve, and it does not pretend to.

### Where the reserve is actually enforced, and why it is now in three places

`DOCK_TERM_RESERVE_PX` (240px) changed meaning without changing value when the
dock started displacing: it used to be how much of the grid an open dock could
never *cover*, and it is now how much of the row the grid never *gives up*. Same
promise either way — a panel that can consume its own host entirely is a way to
lose the app, the same reason `overlaysize.ts` reserves `TERM_RESERVE_H` on the
other axis.

**`.sidedock { max-width: max(280px, calc(100% - 240px)) }`** bounds what the
dock *asks for*. The first revision applied the reserve **only on the drag path**
(`clampDockWidth(…, workspaceEl.clientWidth)`), which left three ways to get a
dock that took the entire grid: boot, a restore from persistence, and any window
resize after the drag. Drag to 900px on a wide monitor, then shrink the window
toward the app's own 640px `minWidth`, and the dock is still 900px over a ~640px
workspace, with 0 of the promised 240px delivered (#1097 rev-767 B2). CSS closes
all three at once, with no listener to forget. `max()` preserves the documented
narrow-window degradation: below the reserve the minimum wins, exactly as
`clampDockWidth` already decided.

**`#grid-area { min-width: 240px }`** is the floor the grid *keeps*, and it
exists because the max-width above is measured against the whole workspace and
**cannot see `#sessions`**, which takes 344px of the same row. That was harmless
while the dock only covered the grid; once it displaces, the two panels compete
for one row. On a 640px window with both open they want 764px, and a grid at
`min-width: 0` would hand over every pixel it had and render nothing while both
panels kept their full width. So the floor goes on the thing being protected,
and `.sidedock`'s `flex: 0 1 auto` is its other half: the dock is the row's only
shrinkable item, so a squeezed row costs the dock its width rather than costing
the grid its existence.

**`clampDockWidth`, against the room the dock and the grid SHARE**, is the third,
and it bounds the two things CSS cannot see: the width that gets *persisted*, and
the width the panel inside the column is laid out at. The quantity matters — it
is not the workspace's width. Those were the same number while the dock was an
overlay, and #1150 pulled them apart by 344px: passing the workspace's width
accepted every width in that gap, so a drag past what the row could seat stopped
tracking the pointer while the number being persisted kept climbing, and the next
boot restored a width the layout silently ignored (#1189 review, finding 2 — the
same "measured against the wrong whole" defect as the CSS half, caught at the
other call site).

`test/sidedockmodel.test.ts` reads **both** stylesheet rules off disk and fails if
either copy of `DOCK_MIN_W` or `DOCK_TERM_RESERVE_PX` drifts from the module — the
same both-ways pinning `theme.test.ts` applies to the palette, and the reason
duplicating the numbers is safe here — and pins the drag's own call site to the
shared room, because the function being right is worth nothing if its argument is
the wrong quantity.

## Colour, and the two channels on one row

The tabs sit on two of the three colour channels at once
(`docs/design/ui-redesign.md` §The three colour channels), on different
properties, which is what keeps them readable as different questions:

- the **active tab's underline** is `--accent` — the one interaction colour, and
  "the active tab" is one of the four positions the brief lists for it;
- each tab's **icon** carries its own identity dye, through the registry's
  documented role mapping and never a hue picked here: `git-graph` is `vcs`
  (lime), `folder-open` is `workspace` (cyan), `file-pen` is `source` (amber) —
  the same three questions the tabs themselves answer.

The `hold` notice is **achromatic on purpose**. The honest dye for an
unsaved-edits warning is `--state-attention`, and that token is reserved to the
agent *state* positions (the warp thread, the status chip, the state dot);
reaching for a different hue merely because it is permitted is the "it needed a
slightly different blue" failure maintainability rule 2 refuses. It says it with
primary ink and a hairline instead.

**No shadow.** `--shadow-float` is a 40px soft shadow and its penumbra would
fall on a live WebGL terminal canvas — the documented way to make this app slow
(`docs/design/performance.md`) and what maintainability rule 5 refuses. The dock
separates the way principle 1 says surfaces should: elevation plus a hairline.

## The resize grip, which is a real divider now

The dock is width-draggable, persisted on release only. This used to be the
cheapest drag in the app — there was no terminal on the other side of it, so the
gesture moved nothing but the dock's own box. #1150 put the grid on the other
side of it, which makes it a divider like any other, and it is treated like one:

**The drag is bracketed with `beginResizeHold` / `endResizeHold` (#432)**, the
mechanism `grid.ts` already uses for a split divider, reached through a
`holdPaneResizes()` callback on `SideDockHost` because app-level chrome has no
business knowing which panes exist. xterm keeps re-fitting on every tick so the
terminals track the drag; the `ResizePseudoConsole` call is withheld until
release. This is not a second coalescer — it is the one that was already there,
for the gesture shape it was built for.

The distinction from the toggle is the point, and `test/resizeburst.test.ts`
measures both. A **transition** has no end to hook but it *settles*, so
`resizeburst.ts`'s window resolves it: one fit per pane, at the settled size, no
bracketing required — for one transition. Chain a second onto its tail (the room
moving under the dock while `#sessions` slides) and the composite burst can
outlast the ceiling instead, which is #1203 above. A **drag** never settles for as long as the human holds the
mouse, so the coalescer correctly falls back to its ceiling and fits every
`FIT_MAX_WAIT_MS` (400 ms) — deliberately, because a terminal frozen at its
pre-drag size for the whole gesture is the failure that ceiling exists to
prevent. A drag *does* have an end to hook, so it gets the bracket, and a 2 s
drag costs one ConPTY resize per pane instead of five.

Two smaller pieces: the drag goes through `startDragSession` (so the hold cannot
strand on an Alt-Tab-away mid-drag — `onEnd` fires exactly once, from mouseup,
blur or Escape), and `.sidedock.resizing` turns the width transition **off**,
because the toggle's 240 ms ease on a mousemove-driven width would both trail the
pointer and keep the geometry moving after the human stopped. The same
`.resizing` class keeps its `content-visibility: hidden` treatment for the hosted
views' heavy lists, shared with the embed slots and floating overlays.

## Deliberately out of scope

- **A tasks tab.** #934's sketch includes one, and #1020 item 6 — the ask this
  actually implements — lists git, file-explorer and file-editor only. A tasks
  tab is a small addition on top of `DOCK_TABS` (`test/sidedockmodel.test.ts`
  pins the set at three, so one arriving without the wiring is noticed), but it
  is not what was asked for here, and `TasksView` is gated on a pane's
  orchestration group in a way an app-level dock has no answer for yet.
- **A keyboard toggle.** Every free chord has to clear the
  `agent-cli-reference` check first — a `Ctrl+Shift+` binding is withheld from
  every terminal pane, so taking one steals it from whatever CLI is running,
  with no escape hatch — and that check is a doc read this change did not do. A
  dock nobody can toggle from the keyboard is a missing convenience; a dock that
  eats an agent's binding is a defect.
- **Following a `cd` within the focused pane** — see above.
