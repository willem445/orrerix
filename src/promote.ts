// Promote-a-standalone-pane-to-orchestrator (#407), pure half. DOM-free and
// backend-free — mirrors resumeerror.ts / panemenu.ts: everything about this
// gesture that is a DECISION (what the human is told before they consent, what
// the relaunched pane is spawned with, what they are told when it fails after
// the kill) lives here and is unit-tested; orchestration.ts is the DOM/IPC shell
// that shows the dialog, calls the command, and drives the pane.
//
// The gesture, in one line: the pane's own CLI session is relaunched IN PLACE
// with the full orchestrator contract, so an hour of prototype conversation
// becomes the orchestrator's own context instead of being hand-summarized into a
// fresh one. See docs/design/orchestration.md's #407 section for the backend half.

/** Strip the machine-readable `promote-<tag>:` prefix off a backend refusal,
 *  leaving the sentence behind it.
 *
 *  Every promote refusal is tagged (mod.rs, mirroring the `resume-<tag>:`
 *  convention `resumeerror.ts` parses) so the frontend can route on the reason.
 *  Promotion has exactly one route for all seven — "say why, change nothing" —
 *  because every refusal happens BEFORE anything is created, retired or killed,
 *  so there is no recovery to offer and no state to clean up. What is left is
 *  presentation: the tag is for code, the sentence is for the human, and showing
 *  both makes a toast the human has to parse before they can read it.
 *
 *  Anything without a recognized tag (an IPC failure, a `String(err)` of
 *  something that was never a backend refusal) comes back untouched — better a
 *  raw message than a swallowed one. */

 *  opens (or converts a welcome pane into) a NEW pane and discards it on any
 *  failure, which is the exact inverse of what a promoted pane needs — see
