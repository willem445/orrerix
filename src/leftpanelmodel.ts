// The DOM-free half of the left panel's tab host (#2122 slice B): which tab a
// toggle lands on, and what survives a restart. `src/leftpanel.ts` is the DOM
// that applies these decisions — the same split `sidedock.ts` /
// `sidedockmodel.ts` already uses, and for the same reason: a transition table
// is worth testing, and a panel is not something `node --test` can hold.
//
// WHY THE TRANSITION IS A FUNCTION AT ALL. `#sessions` is an in-flow panel, so
// its width change is the one DISCRETE HUMAN CLICK that CLAUDE.md constraint 1
// sanctions and `resizeburst.ts` coalesces into one fit per pane. The width is
// bound to `visible` and to nothing else, so "does this gesture resize the
// grid?" is exactly "does this gesture change `visible`?" — one question, asked
// of one boolean, in one place a test can enumerate. A tab SWITCH must answer
// no: it moves no column, so it costs no PTY resize, which is what makes two
// tabs in one panel permissible where a third in-flow panel would not be
// (docs/design/side-dock.md).
