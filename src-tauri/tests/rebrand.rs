//! #1153 phase 3: the emit side of the protocol rename stays single-spelled.
//!
//! The rename's whole rule is **emit one spelling, accept every spelling**. The
//! *accept* half is behavioural and is pinned by behavioural tests — the
//! marker set against the sanitizer (`brand`), a pre-rename transcript against
//! `detect_orch_signature` (`sessions`), a pre-rename queue entry against
//! `is_loomux_notice` (`queue`), a pre-rename launch command against
//! `stripSoloMcpFlags` (`test/panerestore.test.ts`).
//!
//! The *emit* half has no such test, and cannot have one: it is a claim about
//! every emitter that exists, including the one somebody writes next week by
//! copying the line above it. A new `format!("[loomux] …")` would compile, run,
//! and deliver a notice that every reader still accepts — which is exactly why
//! nothing would go red. This scan is what makes that a failure.
//!
//! # What it decides on
//!
//! Default-deny on the **token**, never on a binding's name (the repo's
//! source-scanning-guard convention): a legacy protocol literal on a code line
//! anywhere under the scanned roots is a failure unless its file is on
//! `ALLOWED`, and each row there carries the reason it is allowed and is
//! re-checked so a stale row fails loudly rather than watching nothing.
//!
//! # Stated blind spots
//!
//! - **Comment lines are skipped.** They discuss the legacy spelling by
//!   design — `brand`'s own docs argue at length about why each legacy
//!   constant exists — and a marker in a comment emits nothing.
//! - **A literal split across a concatenation** (`"[loo" "mux]"`) or built at
//!   runtime (`format!("[{}]", legacy)`) is invisible here. Neither appears
//!   today; the point of saying so is that this scan is a net, not a proof.
//! - **Only Rust source and the role templates are scanned**, and within them
//!   only the SHIPPED part. The frontend legitimately holds both spellings
//!   (`panerestore.ts`'s accepted arrays are the feature, not a leak), and
//!   every test suite holds pre-rename specimens on purpose — including the
//!   `#[cfg(test)]` modules that live INSIDE a scanned file, which is why
//!   scanning stops at the first one. Allow-listing all of those instead
//!   would leave the scan enforcing nothing worth the file it lives in.
//! - **Two accepted spellings are un-bannable, and that is the scan's widest
//!   hole** (rev-967 N2). `brand::LEGACY_AUDIT_ACTOR` and
//!   `brand::LEGACY_MCP_SERVER` are both the bare word `loomux`, which also
//!   names the crate, the launcher binary, the worktree convention and a
//!   thousand comments — banning it as a literal would be noise, not a
//!   guard. So a newly hand-written `, "loomux",` audit-actor argument is
//!   invisible here. That is exactly the shape of the defect this PR caught
//!   in itself: a bulk sweep put `brand::AUDIT_ACTOR` where a launcher
//!   FILENAME belonged, and `tests/pathseg.rs` caught it for an unrelated
//!   reason. Stated so the next reader does not mistake this scan's silence
//!   on the bare word for coverage of it.
//! - **Scanning stops at the first `#[cfg(test)]` line and does not resume.**
//!   True for this repo, where the convention is one trailing test module per
//!   file, and stated because it is a real limit rather than a proof: a file
//!   that put production code AFTER a test module would go unscanned from
//!   that point. Nothing does today.
