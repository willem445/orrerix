//! Functional tests for the block model and `.loomux/workflow.yml` (#222).
//!
//! These live as integration tests (not unit tests) because test executables
//! that link the full lib need the common-controls-v6 manifest embedded via
//! `rustc-link-arg-tests` (see build.rs / test.manifest), which cargo only
//! applies to integration-test targets — CLAUDE.md constraint 4.
//!
//! The two invariants most of this file exists to defend:
//!
//! 1. **A workflow file can never grant a capability.** It selects a `kind` from
//!    a closed enum; there is no `read_only: false`, no fifth class, and an
//!    unknown `kind` is rejected outright rather than becoming a worker.
//! 2. **A repo with no workflow file behaves exactly as it did before blocks
//!    existed** — down to the emitted command line.
//!
//! No test here spawns a real agent CLI. The command lines are *built* and
//! asserted; nothing is executed.

// ───────────────── intake: schema + profile resolution (#382 P1) ───────────
//
// The `intake:` block declares intake source + label vocabulary — the
// missing sibling of `gates:` ("where work comes from" beside "what gates
// it"). Three invariants this section defends:
//
// 1. **`deny_unknown_fields` makes any disable-spelling a hard parse error.**
//    `human_gate: false` (or any key this schema doesn't name) is not an
//    ignored line — it's a parse failure, at every nesting level the schema
//    offers. This is the CRITICAL invariant: there is no way to spell "skip
//    the human merge gate" through this file, by construction.
// 2. **A repo declaring nothing, or only part of an `intake:` block, resolves
//    to `builtin_intake_profile()`** — the golden-fixture dodge the plan
//    calls out for P2: the const and the parser are independent, so either
//    drifting is a visible test failure, not a render-against-itself
//    tautology.
// 3. **The resolved profile rides the SAME advanced-orchestrator consent gate
//    the roster override does** — a Fresh launch with the toggle on is the
//    only path that lets a repo's `intake:` block take effect; a resume is
//    pinned to what group.json already has, exactly like `blocks`.

/// which one a GROUP runs, and it is repo-scoped rather than group-scoped.
///
/// The plan predicted two. `orch_workflow_preview_sync` was the second, and it
/// stopped being one when it gained its optional `name` — its no-name arm now
/// goes through `load_workflow_named` at `default` like everything else. This
/// scan is what noticed: the stale-row assertion below refused to carry a row
/// that matched nothing, rather than letting the count go quietly wrong.
///
/// **Three spellings, not one**, and the counts below are measured at both ends
/// rather than recalled — the first version of this paragraph guessed them and
/// got all four wrong (rev-std round 2, finding 1; the widening itself was
/// rev-final round 2, finding 2).
///
/// `git grep -c -F <spelling> <base> -- src-tauri/src` at base `34f92793`, and
/// the same count at head:
///
/// | spelling | base | head | rerouted |
/// | --- | --- | --- | --- |
/// | `workflow::load_workflow(` | 13 (`gh.rs` 1, `mod.rs` 11, `rdtick.rs` 1) | 1 | 12 |
/// | `workflow::workflow_path(` | 12 (all `mod.rs`) | 0 | 12 |
/// | `workflow::workflow_file_exists(` | 2 (`mod.rs`) | 0 | 2 |
///
/// So **26 sites moved, and 14 of them — every `workflow_path` and every
/// `workflow_file_exists` — were invisible to a trigger watching
/// `load_workflow` alone.** All three functions are still `pub` and still answer
/// only for `default`. Adding an audit line or a template var as
/// `workflow::workflow_path(&g.repo)` type-checks, reads naturally, and is
/// exactly what twelve lines in `mod.rs` said one commit ago; a group running
/// `b.yml` would then be told in its own audit trail that it runs
/// `.orrerix/workflow.yml`.
///
/// A textual scan, with the limits that implies — it reads call TEXT, so a
/// caller that bound the function to a local first would be invisible. **So
/// would an UNQUALIFIED call**: `use loomux_engine::workflow::load_workflow;`
/// followed by a bare `load_workflow(&g.repo)` matches none of the three
/// patterns, and this is worth naming concretely rather than leaving inside
/// "textual", because widening the trigger from one spelling to three makes the
/// scan look stronger against exactly that shape than it is (rev-std round 2,
/// premortem 1). Nothing in `src-tauri/src` imports any of the three today, and
/// nothing here enforces that.
///
/// What it IS defence in depth over is a NEW group-scoped reader being added
/// against one of those three in the spelling the rest of the file uses, which
/// is how the reroute would realistically erode; the compiler cannot help
/// there, because all of them exist and all of them type-check.
