# `GroupId` and server-declared path roots

Issue #904. This is layer 2 of the three-layer authorization model in #888's
architecture proposal (§0), landed on the desktop side while it is still a pure
internal refactor with no behavior change for valid input.

## The argument

CLAUDE.md hard constraint 6 **used to say** orchestration commands trust
`group_id` as a path segment; this change is why it no longer does. Read
carefully, that sentence never claimed the id was safe — it claimed the *caller*
was. `OrchRegistry::group_dir` **was** `self.root.join(group)`:
no validation, no canonicalization, and the single membership guard on that path
lived in `save_attachment` alone, added as "cheap hardening on top of the
pre-existing trusted-webview model".

That trust was derived from **process locality**. The only thing that can invoke
a `#[tauri::command]` today is still our own webview, in this process. That is a fact
about the transport, not a credential — nobody issued it, nothing checks it, and
it cannot be revoked. Reproduce the same command surface over a socket, which is
exactly what #888 proposes, and the fact evaporates: every peer that can open a
connection becomes "the webview".

So the fix is not "add a check to the network layer later". It is to stop
deriving the property from the transport at all, and to make it a property of
the **value** instead — one that travels with the id, is established once, and
holds regardless of who called.

That is why this landed early, and separately from #888: as an internal
refactor it is cheap, reviewable in isolation, and independently valuable. Bolted
on next to a new listener it would be a security change reviewed under schedule
pressure, in the same PR as the thing that made it urgent.

## What a group id is

Group ids are loomux-minted tokens. They are never prose, never user input, and
never reach us from anywhere that gets to choose their shape freely:

| source | shape |
| --- | --- |
| `group_id_for_repo` | `{slug}-{8hex}` — slug is ≤24 chars of `[A-Za-z0-9_-]` off the repo directory name, lowercased; hash is FNV-1a folded to 32 bits |
| `create_group_ex` / `promote_orchestrator_cli` | the above, plus `-{n}` for a second concurrent group on one repo |
| `SOLO_GROUP` | the fixed constant `__solo__` |
| the orchestration root's directory listing | whatever is on disk — which is one of the above, or something that should not be there |
| a transcript scrape (`sessions::detect_orch_signature`) | agent-writable; see below |

Because the real alphabet is that narrow, a strict check costs nothing and buys
everything. The rule is:

- non-empty, at most 64 bytes;
- `[A-Za-z0-9_-]` only;
- no leading `-`;
- not a Windows reserved device name.

The alphabet is doing almost all the work, and it does it by *exclusion* rather
than by enumerating attacks. `.` is not in it, so `..` and `.` are unspellable.
`/` and `\` are not in it, so no id names more than one path component. `:` is
not in it, so no drive letter and no NTFS alternate data stream. Control bytes
and whitespace are not in it, so no NUL truncation and no log-line injection.
Non-ASCII is not in it, so Unicode normalization and homoglyph confusion never
arise. There is no blocklist to keep current.

The two rules that are *not* consequences of the alphabet are worth their own
lines. A leading `-` is perfectly legal in a path but is an option to any command
line the id reaches — the same hazard `mergeq::valid_id_component` already
refuses for merge-queue batch ids, which this type's rules are deliberately
modelled on. And a Windows device name (`CON`, `NUL`, `COM3`, …) is a path that
opens a device rather than naming a file; no minted id is ever a bare device
name, so refusing them costs nothing.

### Refused, never rewritten

`GroupId::parse` does not trim, lowercase, strip or sanitize. An id is either
usable exactly as written or it is refused.

This matters more than it looks. Normalizing would let two distinct strings name
one directory — and the moment that is true, a membership check and a path join
can disagree about which group they are talking about, which is the bug class
the check exists to prevent. `mergeq::valid_id_component` makes the same choice
and says so in the same words.

### The minter and the validator must not be able to disagree

A validator that refuses a real group id is not hardening, it is an outage. So
the acceptance half of the test suite is as load-bearing as the refusal half,
and the strongest form of it is a property rather than a list:
`group_id_for_repo` is fed hostile *repo paths* and its output must satisfy
`GroupId::parse` every time.

One shape used to break that property: a repo directory whose name begins with
`-` produced a slug — and therefore an id — that led with a dash. The minter now
strips leading dashes, so it cannot mint something its own validator would
reject. The behavioral delta is confined to repo directories named `-…`, which
get a different state directory than they would have before.

## The declared roots

The second half of #904's title. A group path is not something each call site
derives; it is something the backend *declares*, in one place, from a value that
is already proof.

There were four raw `root.join(group)` sites, plus a fifth interpolation that
does not touch loomux's root at all. None of them survive — every one now routes
through `group_dir_at`, and the source guard keeps it that way:

1. `OrchRegistry::group_dir` — the main one, 78 call sites.
2. `append_audit` — the audit log.
3. `promptsubmit_marker_path` — the hook marker.
4. `sessions.rs`'s group-existence probe.
5. `generated_agent_handle` — `loomux-<group>-<block>`, which becomes a **file
   name** under `~/.claude/agents` and `~/.copilot/agents`.

The fifth is the most dangerous and the least obvious, because it is the only one
whose blast radius is outside loomux's own state directory entirely: a separator
in the group id would not traverse within `%APPDATA%\loomux\orchestration`, it
would write into the user's CLI configuration — and `end_group`'s reclaim then
deletes by the same shape.

**The rest of this section is history, kept because the reasoning is still worth
reading — but it describes the FIRST slice, not the shipped state.** In slice 1
sites 2–5 validated at their own join and failed closed, each in a way suited to
its call site, because a refusal has to go somewhere:

- `append_audit` dropped the record and left a breadcrumb. Auditing is
  best-effort by contract — it must never take the orchestration down — and the
  function returns `()`, so there is no caller with anywhere to put an error.
  The breadcrumb names the `GroupIdError`, never the offending string: an id that
  reached here was chosen by the caller, and echoing it verbatim into a log file
  is how log injection starts.
- `promptsubmit_marker_path` and `generated_agent_handle` returned `None`. Their
  callers already return `Option`, so the refusal was a `?`.
  (`promptsubmit_marker_path` takes a `GroupId` and is infallible again now;
  `generated_agent_handle` still returns `Option` for its `?` ergonomics.)
- `sessions.rs` read a refused id as "no group", which is the same answer it
  already gives for a session with no orchestration signature.

Site 1, `group_dir`, could not be validated locally: its return type is
`PathBuf`, which has no refusal channel, and its 78 callers are spread across the
registry. It is converted by threading the type instead — and that is what the
second slice did. `group_dir` now takes a `&GroupId`; the ~50 `orch_*` commands
parse their `String` once, at the boundary, in `command_group`; and the id
travels as a type from there.

Two consequences worth naming, because both were discovered by the compiler
rather than designed:

- **`AttentionItem.group` went back to `String`.** Its own doc says the field is
  *empty* for a plain, non-orchestration pane — and a `GroupId` cannot be empty.
  That is the type earning its keep: a slot whose empty value is meaningful is a
  display slot, not a group id. It never reaches a path join.
- **`QueuedDelivery.group` became `Option<GroupId>`** — the one field where the
  newtype could not simply replace the `String`, and the one place this design
  had to give ground rather than the code.

  A pre-#468 snapshot has no `group` key, which is what its `#[serde(default)]`
  was for. `GroupId` has no `Default`, so a bare `GroupId` here would make such
  an entry fail to deserialize. The first attempt did exactly that, and argued
  it was an improvement: the entry "was never replayable anyway", so letting
  `read_snapshot`'s `Err(_) => skipped += 1` count it seemed strictly safer.

  That argument was wrong, and the existing suite said so.
  `an_entry_from_an_older_build_parses_but_has_no_durable_identity` pins that a
  legacy entry still **parses**, and its doc comment gives the reason: *"so its
  payload is surfaced as an orphan"*. Failing to parse would have turned a
  recoverable, human-visible payload into an anonymous number — an observability
  regression wearing a safety argument's clothes.

  `Option<GroupId>` says exactly what the empty string used to mean, "no recorded
  identity", but says it in the type: it cannot be confused with a group or
  joined onto a path. Consumers filter with `as_ref() == Some(group)`, so such an
  entry matches nothing and is never replayed into a pane it was not for — which
  is the other half of that test's contract, unchanged.

### Not `AsRef<Path>`, and a test that says so

`GroupId` deliberately does not implement `AsRef<Path>`, so it cannot be passed
to `Path::join` at all. Holding a validated id is not the same as being allowed
to build a path from it wherever you like; a group path comes from
`group_dir_at`, and only from there.

That is half the guarantee. The missing impl stops a `GroupId` reaching a `join`
— it says nothing about the *string* inside one, which would compile fine. So
the other half is `the_orchestration_root_is_joined_with_a_group_in_exactly_one_place`,
a source-scanning test that parses every `.join(` argument under **both**
production source roots — `src-tauri/src` and `crates/loomux-engine/src` — and
flags any naming a group: structural, not a list of spellings, because the
first version *was* a list of spellings and missed one. It enumerates its own
limits rather than claiming completeness: the qualified and bare spellings of
both `AsRef` and `Path` are matched, but an aliased `Path` import, a
macro-generated impl, an impl header split across lines, and `PathBuf::push`
(indistinguishable from `Vec::push`) are all outside a textual scan. None of
them appears in the tree today, and none would be caught if it were the first
one added. That tail is unbounded, and more pattern-matching buys less than it
costs — what holds the property is the compiler: with no `AsRef<Path>` anywhere,
a `GroupId` cannot reach a `join` as a value at all, and the scan is defence in
depth over the *string* inside one.

**Why two roots, and the rule it generalizes to.** `GroupId` itself now lives in
`loomux-engine` (#888 slice A2). Rust's orphan rule means an
`impl AsRef<Path> for GroupId` — a foreign trait on a foreign type — can be
written in exactly one crate, the one that owns the type, so after that move the
only directory the violation can be *spelled* in is `crates/loomux-engine/src`.
A scan left pointing at `src-tauri/src` alone would have passed every run
forever while watching a directory the defect could no longer reach: an inert
tripwire, which is worse than no test, because CLAUDE.md constraint 6 cites this
assertion as the enforcement. The rule for any later move: ask **where the
violation can be spelled now**, not where it used to live. The test guards
against its own staleness too — it asserts per root that files were found, and
that the file *defining* `GroupId` was actually in scope.

A sibling, `every_group_taking_command_parses_its_id_at_the_boundary`, watches
the other end. That one is the more valuable of the two: the sink is a single
function, the sources are fifty, and it was a missing *source* — one command
that never parsed — that survived a whole slice of review.

It exists for a specific reason. **This section's claim was false for the whole
of the first slice** and nothing caught it but a reviewer: `append_audit` and
`promptsubmit_marker_path` are free functions taking a bare `root`, reached from
`deliver_now`, which has no registry — so neither went through
`OrchRegistry::group_dir`, and "and only from there" was prose, not fact. The
fix was to make it true rather than to soften the sentence: `group_dir_at` is now
a free function all four seams delegate to, and the test is what keeps a fifth
from growing back.

`Deref<Target = str>`, `AsRef<str>`, `Borrow<str>` and the `PartialEq` bridges
are implemented, and for a plain reason: they let a `&GroupId` stand in wherever
a `&str` group id stands today, which is what keeps the second half a signature
change rather than a rewrite of every body.

## The root registry

#904 closed the *segment* half of this note's title. This is the *root* half —
#1042, and the mechanism §1.1 H3 of the remote-engine protocol names as the
listener's merge blocker.

The families #904 left alone (`ft_*`, `fm_*`, the 22 `git_*`, the 10 `gh_*`,
`git_watch`, `dir_info`/`change_dir`, and the orchestration boundaries taking a
`repo`) do not take an identifier that becomes a path component. They take an
**absolute root** and check it with `is_dir()`. No segment validator can help
there, and neither can any other predicate over the string: nothing about the
shape of a path separates a repo from `~/.ssh`. The difference is not in the
path — it is in whether anybody ever declared it.

So the answer is server-held state rather than a stronger check. A root is
usable iff it is in a registry, and only sources the engine itself trusts can
put one there.

### It is wire enforcement, not a local sandbox

This is the crux, and it is what keeps the desktop from regressing.

The registry does not exist to constrain the local webview. That webview already
owns the disk — it can open a file picker anywhere — so a rule stopping it from
declaring a root buys nothing and costs real behaviour (a folder chip that goes
dead after an agent `cd`s, a restore that will not restore). Locally, it may
admit anything.

The teeth are in what *cannot* admit. `admit_root` is classified off-roster, so
when the listener's default-deny dispatcher lands, a remote peer can **use**
declared roots and can never **mint** one. Desktop UX therefore survives by
construction, and the enforcement is entirely on the wire — the same shape as
the listener's `ListenTarget`: classify once at a boundary, and make the
unchecked form unrepresentable downstream.

The sources, and the ruling for each, come from a survey of where roots actually
originate — which is emphatically *not* the file picker. A pane's OSC-7 report
is emitted by the process running in that pane, so it is agent-controllable; the
launcher's free-text field and its `localStorage` recents are client state; and
the persisted tabs JSON is replayed on every launch. The organizing rule is that
**a source is an admit path only if it is the local trusted webview acting on
its own state or on a human gesture; everything else is resolve-only.** An
agent that `cd`s to `~/.ssh` gets a quiet folder chip, not a rooted file
browser — while a human clicking "open git view here" on that same pane has
declared something, and that gesture admits.

### Never persisted

The registry is in-memory and rebuilt from its trusted sources on every boot,
and neither type carries a `Serialize` or a `Deserialize`. That absence is
load-bearing rather than an omission.

A registry file would be exactly the replay-poisonable artifact the persisted-tabs
analysis warns about: an entry admitted once — or injected into the file — would
survive every reason it was admitted for, and a client replaying its own tabs
file would be re-asserting authority rather than re-requesting it.
Rebuilt-from-trusted-sources makes replay poisoning structurally impossible at
this layer, which is a stronger guarantee than any validation on the way in.

Note the contrast with `GroupId`, whose `Deserialize` is load-bearing in the
opposite direction: an id has to survive a state file, so the constructor must
guard the way back in. A declared root must not survive one at all.

### The descendant rule

`RootRegistry::resolve` accepts a candidate whose canonical form **equals or is
a descendant of** a declared root, and refuses everything else.

The direction is the whole point. A subdirectory grants strictly *less* than the
root that was declared, so a pane that `cd`s around inside an admitted repo goes
on working with nothing new declared — which is what keeps the OSC-7 consumers
alive without giving an agent-controlled byte stream an admit path. An
**ancestor** grants strictly *more* than was declared, so it is refused, and so
is a sibling whose name merely extends a declared root's (`…/repo-evil` under
`…/repo`) — the reason containment is a component-wise `Path::starts_with` and
never a string prefix.

Refused too: a relative or Windows drive-relative candidate (`C:foo` resolves
against whatever the process happens to have as drive C's current directory,
which nobody declared), and a link whose target leaves every declared root.
Containment is compared canonical-against-canonical, which makes it
symlink-sound in both directions: a link *into* a declared root resolves inside
and grants nothing new; a link *out of* one resolves outside and is refused.

### `plain` and `canonical`, and the `..` that would have split them

`std::fs::canonicalize` on Windows returns an extended-length `\\?\C:\…` path.
That is the right **comparison key** — it resolves links and junctions and
normalizes the case Windows does not care about — and the wrong **working
path**: MSYS git does not want one as a subprocess cwd, and nobody wants to read
one. So a `DeclaredRoot` carries both, and its one accessor `as_path()` hands
back `plain`, the caller's own path with `.` folded away. Commands keep feeding
git/gh/the filesystem the same shape of path they do today, which is what makes
the eventual enforcement behaviourally silent for an admitted root.

`.` folded away, and **not** `..` — which is where this design nearly went wrong,
so the reasoning is worth having in full. `fileedit::safe_resolve` normalizes a
root by folding both, popping the preceding component for each `..`. Copying that
here looks like consistency and is not, because a lexical fold and the filesystem
disagree about what `..` means the moment a symlink precedes it — and both rules
are in play.

The specimen is `<root>/link/../../../../x`, where `link` points four levels deep
inside `<root>`. Unix follows the link and lands on `<root>/x`, *inside* the
declared root, so a containment check passes. Windows folds the `..` lexically in
Win32 normalization before the filesystem sees the path, landing three levels
above the temp directory, where nothing exists. One string, two directories,
decided by the platform — both observed, on the scratch branch that removed the
refusal.

That is why `resolve` **refuses** a `..` rather than folding one. Not because
`plain` would escape on its own — it would not; with the `..` left verbatim the
OS resolves `plain` to exactly what was canonicalized — but because the *next*
layer folds: `safe_resolve`'s `lexical_normalize` does it on every platform, and
it is what slice C hands a declared root to. A root approved against one
directory would then be used against another. A root or cwd argument has no
legitimate `..` in it, so the refusal costs nothing, and it is a refusal rather
than a rewrite for the same reason `GroupId::parse` refuses rather than
sanitizes: normalizing lets two strings name one directory, and that is how a
check and a use end up disagreeing.

### Not `AsRef<Path>`, on the same grounds as `GroupId`

A `DeclaredRoot` has no public constructor, no `From<String>`, no
`Deserialize` and no `AsRef<Path>`. The only way to mint one is
`RootRegistry::resolve`, so holding one is proof that some trusted source
declared a root containing it; and `as_path()` being a named method rather than
a blanket impl is what keeps every place a declared root becomes a working path
greppable. Holding one is not membership, exactly as holding a `GroupId` is not.

The two mechanisms compose without overlapping, and it is worth stating as one
sentence: **a validated segment answers "is this string safe to join under a
root?", a declared root answers "is this root yours to use?"**. They meet at
`safe_resolve(root, rel)`, one parameter each, and neither is a second copy of
the other. Group ids are unaffected: they stay identifiers joined at
`group_dir_at`, and the registry receives group-derived *values* only, so the
one-join guarantee above is untouched.

### The admit tier: who may mint a declared root

The rules above say a root is usable iff a trusted source declared it. This is
what that sentence costs in code, and the reason it is a *tier* rather than a
function is that the sources are not one thing.

**`admit_root` (`src-tauri/src/rootreg.rs`) is the display-side door**, and its
classification is the enforcement: **class `disabled`** (§5.2 of
`remote-engine-protocol.md`) — absent from the wire roster and advertised as
absent, exactly like `open_in_editor` and `fm_open`. It is deliberately *not*
`client-local`, which means "runs in the desktop client's own Rust and never
crosses"; this one has to reach the engine's registry. It has no tier, because
it is never on the wire to have one. That single classification is the whole
teeth of #1042: a remote peer can **use** declared roots and can never **mint**
one. If an authenticated remote admit path is ever wanted it re-enters the
roster as `wire`/**owner** behind auth — a capability *added* later, which is
H3's rule and the opposite of one removed later.

**The frontend calls it at every source the ruling above makes an admit path**,
and only there: the four `pickDirectory` results (a native dialog the backend
never sees, which is why the door has to exist at all — enforcing
server-declared roots without it would break desktop browsing outright), the
launcher's submit for every kind that carries a root or a cwd, and session
restore for every recorded one. Restore is the trusted webview re-declaring its
*own* persisted state, which is the same authority that admitted it originally;
a remote client replaying a tabs file gets the declaration refused and lands on
the fail-soft welcome form that arm already opens for a deleted folder.

**A human gesture on a pane's live cwd admits; the cwd's own arrival does not.**
Opening the git, issues or editor view on a pane declares that pane's cwd, and
`onCwdReported` — the OSC-7 handler, fed by whatever process is running in the
pane — declares nothing. That is the untrusted-source ruling made concrete, and
it is why an agent that `cd`s to `~/.ssh` gets a quiet folder chip rather than a
rooted file browser. Never for an SSH pane, whose cwd names a directory on the
remote machine.

**Two engine-derived sources declare without any webview at all**, because they
are values the engine computed rather than strings a caller supplied: a group's
checkout, as orchestration creates *or resumes* the group, and a worktree the
engine cut. Worktrees need their own declaration and are easy to forget: loomux
puts them at `<repo>-worktrees/<name>`, a **sibling** of the checkout, so the
descendant rule does not reach them and an agent could not browse its own
workspace.

The registry is therefore owned by `OrchRegistry` and `manage`d from `lib.rs` as
the same `Arc`, rather than created in `lib.rs` and handed over. The reason is
that one of its two populators *is* that registry: a populator wired by a
`set_roots` call is a populator that can be forgotten, and forgetting it would
be invisible until slice C turned it into a desktop regression.

Deliberately **not** admit paths, each argued: `spawn_pty`'s cwd (widening the
filesystem surface as a side effect of spawning would be an admit path the
roster cannot see, and tiers will later narrow spawn without wanting fs access
widened along with it), the merge queue's temporary worktrees (built and torn
down inside one batch, never a caller's root), and the `git_repo_root` ancestor
the launcher resolves when opening a git pane on a subdirectory — an ancestor
grants strictly more than the human named, and nothing uses it as a root.

One consequence of landing admits before refusals is worth naming rather than
discovering later. A group's checkout arrives, on the *create* path, as a caller
argument, so until the orchestration `repo` boundaries resolve it, `create_group`
is on paper a way to launder an undeclared root into the registry. It is inert —
nothing enforces and no wire exists — and the rule that closes it is one line:
**any command that would cause a root to become registered from a caller
argument must itself take an already-declared root.**

### What has landed, and what has not

Slice A — this section's mechanism — is `crates/loomux-engine/src/rootreg.rs`:
`RootRegistry`, `DeclaredRoot`, `RootError` and their unit tests, in the
Tauri-free core so the daemon can link them. It is std-only and mints no ids, so
CLAUDE.md constraint 2 holds trivially.

Slice B is the admit tier above: the `admit_root` command and the `Arc` that
holds the registry, the two engine-derived declarations, and the frontend
admit-at-source wiring. `src-tauri/tests/rootreg.rs` pins it — including two
source scans, one refusing an `AsRef<Path>` on `DeclaredRoot` (the sibling of
`GroupId`'s own refusal) and one holding this note's claim that the sites listed
above are *all* the ways a root gets declared.

**Nothing resolves yet, and no command refuses anything it did not refuse
before.** The registry fills; that is all it does. Boundary `resolve` on every
root-taking family — with the choke functions changing signature so the compiler
holds the property — is slice C, and it is slice C that introduces the
`root-not-declared` error code to a caller. Until then the code exists on
`RootError` and is returned to nobody. Slice C also owes the
`git_repo_root`/ancestor question if it ever needs a root of its own, and the
TOCTOU reasoning for a symlink swapped after `resolve` canonicalized it.

`admit_root`'s §5.4 roster row is **placed** (#996) — class `disabled`, the
classification argued here and in the command's own doc comment. What slice C
still owes there is the *enforcement*, not the row: C2's roster test is what
reads the table and makes a future unplaced command fail CI, which is the
wording `remote-engine-protocol.md` §5.4 now carries too. Do not add a second
`rootreg` row — the table partitions `APP_COMMANDS` exactly, and a duplicate is
the two-copies-drift failure §5.4 exists to argue against.

Deferred past all three, and recorded so the absence is deliberate: a
`roots_list` wire command and a daemon config's seeded roots (there is no wire
to serve them over yet), an authenticated remote admit path (an escape hatch to
be *added* later, never one removed later), and eviction — the registry is
unbounded because a session declares a handful of roots at a few hundred bytes
each, and an eviction rule needs an answer to "is this root still in use by an
open pane, a watcher, a queued delivery?" whose wrong answer is a live
regression.

## The one agent-writable source

Every group id above is loomux-minted or read back from loomux's own state, with
one exception: `sessions::detect_orch_signature` scrapes the id out of an agent
CLI's transcript by looking for the kickoff phrase and taking what follows.

A transcript is a file the CLI writes from the agent's own conversation. Any text
an agent emits can contain that phrase and choose what comes after it. The
scraped id then travels: `Parsed.orch_gid` → the persisted session index →
`SessionInfo.orch_group` → the frontend → back in as
`resume_orch_session(group_hint)`, which joins it onto the orchestration root.

The scrape's `take_while` alphabet was the only thing standing between that loop
and a traversal. It happens to exclude separators, which is why this was never
exploitable — but "happens to" is not a specification, and the charset lives in
a function whose job is text-matching, not path safety. The scrape now runs its
result through `GroupId::parse`, which is the one place that decides what a group
id may be, and the persisted value is re-validated on the way back out as well:
an index entry written by an older build is not evidence of anything.

## Deserialization is a construction site

`GroupId`'s `Deserialize` goes through `parse`. A state file written by an older
build — or edited by hand, or corrupted — cannot hand the process an id the
constructor would have refused. `Serialize` is transparent (a bare string), so no
persisted file and no frontend payload changes shape.

## The second family, and the mechanism they now share (#925)

`GroupId` was the first validated segment, not the only one. #925 found **four**
near-identical answers to "is this string a usable path component" — this one,
`mergeq::valid_id_component`, `orchestration::sanitize_session`, and
`digest::is_safe_session_id` — and the problem was not the duplication but the
**drift**. They were four points on a slope, and the weakest of them was the one
guarding a live `Path::join`.

`is_safe_session_id` was `!empty && !contains(['/','\\']) && != "." && != ".."`.
It sat in front of `copilot_session_state_root().join(session_id)`, and `"C:"`
passed it: on Windows that parses as a `Prefix` component, and `Path::join`
**replaces** its receiver when the argument carries a prefix, so the session
directory became `C:` and the read resolved drive-relative to the process's own
cwd — outside the session-state root, with no separator anywhere in the id. A
device name, a leading `-`, an unbounded length, a NUL and every non-ASCII byte
passed it too.

So the rules moved to one checker, `pathseg::check_segment`, and the families are
expressed through it:

- **`PathSegment`** — the shared newtype, same contract as `GroupId` (one gate,
  `Deserialize` through it, refused-never-rewritten, no `AsRef<Path>`).
- **`GroupId` keeps its own type.** A group id and a session id must not be
  substitutable at a call site merely because both are path-safe. What it stopped
  owning is a private copy of the rules — and its error *text* stays
  group-specific, because `command_group` surfaces it and "group id is empty"
  diagnoses better than "identifier is empty". Shared mechanism, local
  diagnostics.
- **The agent-session id** is a `PathSegment`, parsed once in
  `read_session_transcript_events` and threaded to both path arms.
  `usage::claude_transcript_path` and the new `sessions::copilot_session_dir_at`
  — this family's declared assembly point, `group_dir_at`'s counterpart — take
  the type at their signatures, so an unvalidated string cannot reach either.
  Deliberately **not** named `SessionId`: `remote-engine-protocol.md` already
  uses that for a *connection* session, and §6.0 forbids a bare "session"
  precisely because three different things claim the word.
- **The agent id** is a `PathSegment` wherever it becomes part of a file name
  (`{id}.json`, `ledger-{id}.log`, `{id}-hooks.json`,
  `{id}-gemini-policy.toml`, `{id}.promptsubmit.jsonl`).

Two validators keep their `trim()`, deliberately: `valid_id_component` and
`sanitize_session` accept a configured id with stray whitespace today, and
removing that would be a behavior change wearing a refactor's clothes. Only the
checks are shared, not the trimming. Both do gain the reserved-device-name
refusal, which is a strengthening no real id notices.

### The tripwires, generalized

`the_orchestration_root_is_joined_with_a_group_in_exactly_one_place` grew from
one permitted assembly point to **one row per identifier family**, each required
to appear exactly once — so a new family adds a row and inherits the count
instead of growing a parallel test that could drift from this one. Zero
occurrences now fails as loudly as two: a renamed assembly point would otherwise
leave the scan watching nothing.

That scan is default-deny on the orchestration-root *receiver* and the
`.as_str()` *shape*, and the filename family crosses neither —
`claude_transcript_path` builds `format!("{session}.jsonl")` on one line and
joins it on another; `ledger_path`'s receiver is a group dir, not the root. So it
has its own guard, `no_raw_identifier_is_interpolated_into_a_file_name` in
`tests/pathseg.rs`.

**Its trigger is a shape, and deliberately names nothing.** A `format!` whose
template both interpolates something *and* carries a file-extension literal is a
file name being built out of a value — that is the whole test. It does not ask
what the binding is called, and the extension is matched **inside the `format!`
string literal** rather than anywhere on the line, so a `json!` carrying a
`.json` in a sibling string is not mistaken for a path build. `#[cfg(test)]`
regions are skipped by brace depth, the same exclusion the sibling scan makes for
`tests/`. Anything flagged is a finding unless its exact text is on an allowlist
with the argument for why it is safe, and each row also names a **proof** — text
that must still be present for that argument to hold — which the scan re-checks.
A row matching nothing fails too, so a renamed site cannot quietly shrink what
the test covers.

The arguments differ by row, and that is the point of writing them down: some
rows are "the binding is a `PathSegment` at this signature", but others are "the
value is a literal at every call site", "it is a minted roster id", "it is a
timestamp, not an identifier", or "the builder refuses the id itself". One row is
the known non-member — a workflow block id, validated by the weaker
`workflow::sanitize_id`, which is operator-authored config rather than caller
input and is therefore argued as an allowlist row rather than closed (the full
argument is CLAUDE.md constraint 6).

**Why the trigger names nothing, stated because the first version did.** The
guard originally keyed on a list of binding names, and that is not a limitation
it happened to have — it is a defect that fired. The same change that introduced
the guard also renamed `claude_transcript_path`'s parameter `session_id` →
`session` as ordinary tidying, and that rename alone moved the declared assembly
point for claude transcript paths out of the list and clean out of the scan's
view. A reviewer caught it; the guard could not. CLAUDE.md's
source-scanning-guard convention says exactly this — *a rename steps over a name
heuristic, so it enforces nothing* — and the trigger was rewritten to the shape
in response. Dropping the name list did not merely close that hole: it surfaced
sites the name version had never been able to see, among them the `{program}.cmd`
shim writers, `mqloop`'s body-file name, a crash-log timestamp, and the block-id
`<id>.md` site named above.

Same honesty requirement as its sibling, and the same answer: it is textual, so a
`const` extension (`{handle}{CLAUDE_AGENT_FILE_EXT}` is real and invisible to
it), a name built by `String` concatenation or `PathBuf::push` rather than
`format!`, a template split across lines, and a second `format!` on the same line
as a first all sit outside it. What holds the property is the **signature** — a
function taking `&PathSegment` cannot be handed a `&str` at all — and the scan is
defence in depth over a *new* site being added raw, which is how the guarantee
would realistically erode.

## What this does not do

- It does not authenticate anyone. That is #888 §0 layer 1, and a `GroupId` says
  nothing about whether the caller is entitled to *that* group — only that the
  string is a usable path segment. Membership remains a separate check
  (`save_attachment`'s, and whatever layer 3 adds).
- **It does not re-scope the `ft_*`/`fm_*`/git `repo` roots.** This is the half
  of §0's "server-declared roots" that neither #904 nor #925's segment slice
  touches, and it is worth being exact about why, because the issue text once
  described it as the same `root.join(caller_id)` shape and it is not.

  Those commands take `(root, rel)`. The **`rel` half was already contained** —
  `fileedit::safe_resolve` refuses an absolute or prefixed `rel`, folds `..`
  lexically, bounds the result against the root and refuses a symlinked component
  below it. The **`root` half is the hole**: an arbitrary caller-supplied
  absolute path, checked only for `is_dir()`. That is not a segment problem and
  no segment validator can express it — for a root, absolute is *required*, so no
  string predicate separates `C:/Projects/loomux` from `C:/Users/me/.ssh`. It
  needs the registry `remote-engine-protocol.md` §1.1 H3 specifies: resolve
  against registered repos, worktrees and group dirs, and refuse anything else.

  Tracked as **#1042**, which is the actual C2 merge blocker. **Its slice A has
  landed the *mechanism* (`RootRegistry`, the section above); the re-scoping
  itself is slice C and has not landed** — as of this sentence those families
  still take any absolute path an `is_dir()` accepts. Neither a green segment
  slice nor a landed registry lifts the blocker on its own; the enforcement does.
- It does not make a group id a *capability*. Membership — "is this caller
  entitled to this group?" — is still a separate check, and only
  `save_attachment` performs one today.

## What it does close

Constraint 6 as originally written — "orchestration commands trust `group_id` as
a path segment, safe only because the webview is trusted" — no longer describes
the code. Nothing about a group path now rests on who called: the id is parsed at
the command boundary, travels as a type, and reaches the filesystem through one
helper that will not accept anything else.

What remains for #888 is the part this was always a *prerequisite* for rather
than a substitute for: authenticating the display client (§0 layer 1) and
re-scoping the path-taking `ft_*`/`fm_*`/git families to server-declared roots
(**#1042**). A validated `GroupId` says the string is a usable path segment. It
says nothing about whether the peer holding it should be talking to that group at
all — and #925's segment work says the same of a session or agent id. The
identifier half of §7.1's T2 is closed; the root half is not.

The second of those two now has a mechanism — `RootRegistry` (#1042 slice A) —
and does not yet have its enforcement, which is slice C. Read the root
registry's own "What has landed, and what has not" for the line between them
before citing this note as evidence that a root-taking command is scoped.
