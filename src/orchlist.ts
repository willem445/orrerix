// The session browser's "Orchestrations" section (#1563), as a pure function.
//
// WHAT THIS SECTION IS FOR. Every other route into a recorded orchestration
// goes through a CLI's own session store: the sidebar's session list is a scan
// of `~/.claude/projects`, `~/.copilot/session-state` and the human's GLOBAL
// opencode store. A group's opencode sessions are NOT in that global store —
// they live in `<group>/opencode/opencode.db`, deliberately excluded because a
// bare `--session` pane restored from one would be powerless (see
// `docs/design/opencode.md`). Before #1563 that left a fresh opencode
// orchestrator with no clickable route to the backend resume at all. This
// section reads loomux's own record (`orch_list_recorded`) instead, and it
// lists every CLI in one shape, so it is the primary restart surface rather
// than an opencode workaround.
//
// NOT THE ONLY ROUTE ANY MORE, AND THE DIFFERENCE MATTERS. Slice A (#1563)
// landed the other half: a learned session id now reaches its pane via
// `orch-session-learned` and is persisted to `tabs.json`, so a DORMANT GROUP
// CARD can carry an opencode id too. That route depends on the pane having
// been open when the watcher bound the id, and on that tab set surviving.
// This one depends on neither — it reads the group's own `agents.json`, so it
// still reaches a group whose card was never captured, whose tab was closed,
// or that belongs to a tab set this window does not have.
//
// EVERY "NO BUTTON" CASE HAS ITS OWN SENTENCE. The three ways a row cannot be
// resumed are genuinely different problems with genuinely different answers,
// and collapsing them into one greyed-out button tells the human nothing:
// a running group wants its pane focused, an unidentified orchestrator wants
// waiting (or one manual resume), and a session the CLI's store has lost wants
// a fresh orchestrator on the same board. The copy says which.
//
// DOM-free and IPC-free on purpose: `sessions.ts` renders these rows, and the
// ordering, the filter and the copy are unit-tested here.
