// Unit tests for the pane-facts projection and the agent state ladder

// no clock, no `Pane`.
//
// The fixtures are built to DISCRIMINATE, not merely to pass (CLAUDE.md #1182):
// `the ladder's fixtures vary every field the predicate reads` below enumerates
// the ten inputs `deriveAgentState` actually consults and fails if the corpus
// happens to hold any one of them constant — a field every fixture shares is an
// unpinned axis, and the suite would stay green over a rung that stopped
// reading it.
//
// Red arm (mechanically): reorder any two rungs in `deriveAgentState` and
// `the ladder walks down in precedence order` reddens on that pair; drop the
// `!facts.welcome` term from the dead rung and `a welcome pane is not dead`
// reddens alone; make the orch idle rung ignore `bytesInWindow` and
// `an orch pane the roster calls idle is still working while it paints`
// reddens alone.
