 * `display:none`, and `focus()` on a hidden textarea is a browser no-op. So

 * did nothing the human could see.
 *
 * One function, so those surfaces cannot drift apart again. The tab step is
 * here because `main.ts` is the only holder of `tabs`; the structural steps
 * are `Grid.reveal`'s; the ORDER is `revealPlan`'s (`panefocus.ts`), pinned
 * across all twelve crossings in `test/panefocus.test.ts`.
 *
 * Two steps, not three: `Grid.reveal` ends on the plan's own `focus` step in
 * every one of those crossings, so a `pane.focus()` here as well would be a
 * second focus of the same terminal — harmless, but it is exactly the
 * redundant step the design note claims this design does not emit (#2365
 * review round 1, F3). The claim and the code now agree.

 * review round 2, B1). True for a human gesture — an Agents row click, the
 * Sessions tab's Focus button. False for `orch-focus`, which the orchestrator's
 * `focus_agent` MCP tool emits with no human anywhere on the path: an agent may
 * say which pane it wants attention on, but it may not drop the human out of a
