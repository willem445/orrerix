//! The daemon's config file, and the one decision it makes fail-closed.
//!
//! `remote-engine-protocol.md` §1.2 states two v1 requirements that are what
//! make "reach the daemon over an SSH tunnel" a trust boundary instead of a
//! hope. The second (`Origin` refusal on the WebSocket upgrade) belongs to the
//! listener, which does not exist yet. The first is this file:
//!
//! > The listener binds loopback (or a unix socket) and **refuses a routable
//! > interface** unless an explicit, loudly-named flag says otherwise.
//!
//! # Why the refusal is config-layer validation, not a piece of the listener
//!
//! It is enforced **when the config is parsed**, not when a socket is opened:
//! [`ServerConfig::parse`] returns [`ConfigError::RoutableBindRefused`] and no
//! config exists at all. That is what makes it C1a's rather than a fragment of
//! C2 smuggled forward — it is a statement about which files are valid, it
//! needs no socket to decide, and every test below runs without one.
//!
//! The shape follows `GroupId`'s (#904), which is this repo's precedent for
//! exactly this: **the unsafe state is unrepresentable rather than merely
//! checked.** [`ServerConfig`] holds an already-classified [`ListenTarget`],
//! and the only way to obtain one is through the gate. The `Deserialize` impl
//! is on a *private* raw shape, so a config file cannot deserialize its way
//! past the check either. C2 therefore receives a value the check has already
//! passed rather than a string it must remember to check — the refusal cannot
//! be forgotten by the slice that has the most else going on, and C2 must not
//! re-implement it (recorded in `remote-engine-protocol.md` §1.2 and §13).
//!
//! Nothing here opens a socket, resolves a name or touches a directory.
