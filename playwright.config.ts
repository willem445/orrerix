// E2E PoC (spike — see docs/design/e2e-testing.md). Drives the real WebView2
// webview over CDP (Playwright's native WebView2 support), never a Tauri
// plugin or a bundled browser: `chromium.connectOverCDP` just needs the CDP
// client, not a downloaded Chromium, so there's nothing to `playwright
// install` here.
//
// Single worker: every E2E instance shares one Tauri identifier
// (tauri.e2e.conf.json), and WebView2 keys its browser process off that
// identifier (#394) — so concurrent instances would share a browser process
// with EACH OTHER, not just with a production install. A fixed CDP port
// (e2e/fixtures.ts) is a symptom of the same constraint, not the cause: it's
// fixed because the CI job's HKLM policy workaround for WebView2 150+'s
// High-IL env-var restriction (WebView2Feedback#5640) needs one static value,
// not because ports themselves are scarce. Real parallelization needs
// per-worker identifiers or an isolation mechanism that survives High IL
// (WEBVIEW2_USER_DATA_FOLDER does — see e2e/fixtures.ts's module doc — but
// using it would break the identifier-based build verification that same
// file performs). See docs/design/e2e-testing.md's roadmap.
