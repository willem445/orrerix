///
/// - **The extension is matched inside the `format!` string literal, not
///   anywhere on the line.** `json!({ "reason": "unusable merge_queue.json",
///   "detail": format!("{e:?}") })` has `.json` on the line and builds no path;
///   scoping to the literal drops that shape. (Deliberately not stated as a
///   count: how many such lines exist is a fact about today's tree, and a
///   number here would be wrong on the next commit that adds or removes one.)
/// - **`#[cfg(test)]` regions are skipped**, the same exclusion the sibling scan
///   makes for `tests/`: fixtures build file names from ids constantly, which is
///   their job. Tracked by brace depth from the attribute, so it is the region
///   that is skipped, not a guessed line range.
///
/// # Limits, stated rather than implied
///
/// Textual, like its sibling, and it inherits the same honesty requirement.
/// Not caught, and no attempt is made to: an extension held in a `const`
/// (`{handle}{CLAUDE_AGENT_FILE_EXT}` is real and invisible here); a name built
/// by `String` concatenation or `PathBuf::push` rather than `format!`; a
/// template split across lines; and — because [`format_template`] returns the
/// **first** `format!("` on a line — a second `format!` sharing that line with a
/// first. That last one changes nothing in the tree today (replaying with
/// every-template-per-line finds the same set), which is why it is a stated
/// limit rather than a fix: a scan whose doc enumerates the others and omits
/// this one is implying a completeness it does not have. What actually holds
/// the property is the
/// **signature** — a function taking `&PathSegment` cannot be handed a raw
/// `&str` at all — and this scan is defence in depth over a *new* site being
/// added raw, which is how the guarantee would realistically erode.
///
/// The allowlist's third field is what stops that honesty from being a slogan:

/// is still there. Otherwise the list would be the weakest part of the guard —
/// every row says "safe, because this is a `PathSegment`", a textual scan cannot
