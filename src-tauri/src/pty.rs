///
/// **#1607 (epic #1600 Phase 2.3): the destination is no longer the shared

/// resolved, and `src/ptywrite.ts`'s per-pane chain stopped dispatching — every
/// pane, at once, refusing input while the window kept painting (#1600 §1.2).
/// The body now goes to a thread that belongs to this pane
/// ([`spawn_pane_writer`], reached through [`PtyHandle`]'s `writer_jobs`), so
/// the app's most latency-critical path competes for threads with nothing.
///
/// The alternative shapes were considered and rejected in the plan: a bigger
/// `max_blocking_threads` only moves the cliff, and a dedicated small pool of
/// size k is the same cliff at k wedged panes — sizing k to the pane count IS
/// this, plus bookkeeping.
///
/// **What this does NOT change is ordering, and that is deliberate.** This
/// command still resolves only once the bytes are actually out, because the
/// frontend's ordered writer (`src/ptywrite.ts`, issue #65) keeps exactly one
/// `write_pty` in flight per pane and chains the next one on this promise —
/// that chain, not the backend, is what makes a bracketed paste's terminator
/// unable to overtake its body. Returning early (a queue, a fire-and-forget
/// send) would dissolve both that ordering guarantee and the end-to-end back
/// pressure it rests on: today a pane whose child has stopped reading simply
/// stops accepting chunks, so the unsent remainder waits in the pane's own JS
/// queue and NOTHING accumulates backend-side. A backend queue would have to
/// answer "and what when it fills?" with either unbounded memory or dropped
