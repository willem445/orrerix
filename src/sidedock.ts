// The right-side dock (#1020 item 6, #934): git / files / editor in one
// collapsible panel down the right edge of the workspace, pointed at whichever
// pane is currently active. The pure decisions are in sidedockmodel.ts; the
// argument for the whole shape is docs/design/side-dock.md.
//
// THE ONE STRUCTURAL RULE, and #1150 reversed it. This panel is a FLEX SIBLING
// of `#grid-area` — the mirror of `#sessions` on the other edge — so opening it
// shrinks the grid and the open panes autosize to share the row. It shipped as
// the opposite: `position: absolute`, out of flow, occluding panes precisely so
// that nothing here could ever move a terminal. The human asked for the
// Sessions behaviour instead (#1150, beta1 feedback), and docs/design/side-dock.md
// carries the argument for why that is affordable now and was not before.
//
// The short form, because it is the thing to keep true: a displacing panel used
// to cost one xterm reflow plus one `ResizePseudoConsole` per pane PER FRAME of
// its transition. #1149 moved the coalescing into the fit debounce itself
// (resizeburst.ts), so a whole animated burst collapses into ONE fit per pane at
// the settled geometry. On the TOGGLE this module inherits that by doing nothing
// at all: the panes' own `ResizeObserver`s see the flex row change and the
// shared policy decides the rest. There is no coalescer here and no bracketing
// of the toggle, and anything added would be a second mechanism covering one
// gesture instead of the one mechanism covering every consumer.
//
// "Nothing on the resize path" is NOT true of this module as a whole, and the
// boundary is worth knowing before editing it. `roomObs` (see `onRoomChanged`)
// writes the column's width whenever the ROOM changes, which is what keeps a
// squeezed dock narrow instead of cropped — and a room that is itself animating
// (a `#sessions` slide) therefore re-targets this panel's own 240 ms ease, so
// the composite burst can outlast the coalescer's 400 ms ceiling and take one
// mid-slide fit per pane. Open as #1203, argued in docs/design/side-dock.md,
// deferred rather than fixed blind: the chain is a browser behaviour nothing in
// this repo's test rig can execute.
//
// The one gesture that IS bracketed is the grip drag, and it is bracketed with
// the mechanism that already exists for divider drags (`beginResizeHold` /
// `endResizeHold`, #432) rather than a new one — see `beginResize`.
//
// WHY IT OWNS ITS OWN VIEW INSTANCES. `Pane` already builds a `GitView` and a
// `FileEditView` per pane, for its Alt+G / Alt+F overlays and its #361 embed
// slots. The dock does NOT reach for those: they belong to one pane, and the
// dock belongs to the app — it has to survive the pane it is following being
// closed, and it has to keep showing one folder while the human clicks through
// four panes in three tabs. So it constructs its own, exactly the way
// `Pane.startContent` constructs a content pane's, and the two never interact.
