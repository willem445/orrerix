// Pure, DOM-free weight math for pane splitting (#885). No DOM imports, so
// it's unit-testable under `node --test` (mirrors layout.ts / embedsplit.ts /
// overlaysize.ts); `grid.ts` owns the tree/DOM mutation and asks this module
// only "what weights should the row come out with".
//
// Deliberately no cross-module import (every other pure, node:test-covered
// module in this codebase — layout.ts, overlaysize.ts, embedsplit.ts,
// spawnexpiry.ts, taskboard.ts — is self-contained): tsc's build forbids the
// explicit `.ts` extension an intra-src import would need for `node --test` to
// resolve it directly (TS5097), so a bare specifier here would work for one
// runner and not the other.
//
// WHY THERE ARE TWO POLICIES. A split's cost has to be paid out of somebody's
// pixels, and who pays depends on who asked:
//
//   - A HUMAN splitting the pane they are looking at means "give this new
//     thing space out of THIS pane" — every other pane on screen should sit
//     as still as the layout can hold it. That is `halve`, and it is what
//     tmux/wezterm do.
//   - A PROGRAMMATIC fan-out (the multi-agent welcome form placing five
//     agents at once) means "lay these out as an even matrix". Halving
//     repeatedly there would produce a 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16 sliver staircase.
//     That is `share`, which is what every split did before #885.
//
// Two intents, two policies, one mechanism — see
// `docs/design/pane-splitting-and-floors.md`.
//
// ONLY the SAME-DIRECTION case needs a policy at all. A cross-direction split
// (split-down on a pane inside a row) replaces the target's slot with a nested
// two-way split whose children are 1 and 1 — the target's own slot keeps its
// weight, so the outer row never moves and both policies already agree. That
// path stays in `grid.ts` untouched; there is nothing for this module to
// decide about it.

/** Who pays for the new pane's space in a SAME-DIRECTION split.
 *
 *  - `halve` — the target pane alone: it and the newcomer each take half of
 *    the target's weight, so the row's TOTAL is unchanged and every other
 *    sibling keeps its exact `grow / total` RATIO. Note what that does and
 *    does not promise: a sibling's SHARE of the row is untouched, but the row
 *    itself has one more divider in it, so its free space shrinks by that
 *    divider's ~4px and each sibling loses its ratio's slice of them (~1px in
 *    a typical row — see `planRowSplit`). Every human split gesture uses this.
 *  - `share` — the whole row: the newcomer takes an even 1/N slice on top of
 *    the existing weights, so the total grows and every sibling shrinks
 *    proportionally. Pre-#885 behaviour, kept for programmatic batch
 *    placement. */

 *  negotiates with its two immediate neighbours (grid.ts `makeDivider`,

    // margins, so a 4px outer footprint) taken off the top before free space
    // is distributed. Each sibling therefore loses `ratio × 4px` — about 1px
    // in a four-pane row, about 3.6px for a sibling holding 90% of it. That
    // is usually zero terminal columns, but `shouldResizePty` (panefit.ts)
    // compares a `cols x rows` string, so a sibling whose width sat within
    // 1px of a cell boundary (~8.4px at the default font) does issue one real
    // PTY resize. Fewer resizes than `share`, which moves every sibling by
    // tens of px — not zero. Do not restore the stronger claim.
