// Shared mousedown→mousemove→mouseup drag-session wiring for every divider
// drag in this codebase (grid.ts's pane splits, paneembeds.ts's embed-slot and
// overlay dividers). Extracted after a #361 review: the embed/overlay
// dividers' own copy (mirroring grid.ts's own, pre-existing pattern) only
// cleaned up on `mouseup` — a drag that ends WITHOUT one (Alt-Tab away
// mid-drag fires window `blur`, not `mouseup`; the mouse button is still
// physically down, but the browser never delivers a matching up event to a
// window that no longer has focus) left the `mousedown`-applied state
// stranded. For grid.ts's `dragging` class that's a cosmetic leftover
// highlight; for the embed/overlay dividers' `.resizing` class
// (content-visibility: hidden on the panel's list, #361's drag-perf fix)
// the SAME gap leaves a docked view's list invisible until some LATER,
// unrelated resize happens to touch that side again — a real, not merely
// cosmetic, stuck state. One shared start/end-drag helper, used by every
// divider, means the fix (and any future one) only has to be made once.
//
// No pointercancel listener: every current caller wires plain MOUSE events
// (mousedown/mousemove/mouseup), never Pointer Events — pointercancel has
// no meaning for a listener set that never receives a pointerdown to
// cancel. If a caller ever migrates to Pointer Events, wire pointercancel
// there directly; this helper's `end` set (mouseup/blur/Escape) covers
// every path reachable through the events it actually listens for.
