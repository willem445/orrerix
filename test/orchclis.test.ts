// The launcher's orchestrator-mode CLI catalog (#4 per-role picks, #722 opencode).
//
// What these defend is not "the list has three rows" but the three ways a curated
// suggestion list can cost a human real money or a failed launch:
//
//   1. A ROLE DEFAULT THAT ISN'T OFFERED. `ModelPicker.setOptions` falls to its
//      `custom…` branch for a value outside the list, so a default nobody offers
//      opens the form on a hand-typed id — looking like a human's own choice.
//   2. A DEFAULT LOOMUX INVENTED. On a CLI with no vendor-neutral alias, any id
//      loomux picks silently overrides the model the human already configured.
//      That is why the backend's `default_model("opencode", _)` is empty, and the
//      launcher has to agree with it or the form advertises an inheritance it
//      then overrides.
//   3. AN ID THE LAUNCHER CANNOT PROBE. Orchestrator mode probes the CLI *id*
//      as a program name (`currentProgram`, `orchProgramsToCheck`), so a row
//      whose id is not a launchable program's command warns about the wrong
//      thing — or never warns at all, and the group fails at spawn instead.
