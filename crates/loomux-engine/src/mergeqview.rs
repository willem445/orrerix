//! Read-only merge-queue **view** for the human's chrome (#581 slice F).
//!
//! Design note: `docs/design/merge-queue.md` — §11.3 is the `merge_queue.json`
//! schema this reads, §11.6 is this surface. The note's own words: *one
//! read-only Tauri command `orch_merge_queue` … feeding a DOM-free
//! `src/mergequeue.ts` model*. This file is the backend half of that sentence.
//!
//! # What this is, and what it deliberately is not
//!
//! It **reads one file and projects it**. There is no `git`, no `gh`, no
//! network, no write of any kind, and no decision: the queue's decisions are
//! `mergeq.rs`'s (pure core, slice C) and its actions are the driver's
//! (slice D). A view that could act would be a second, quieter driver.
//!
//! It also does not consult `.loomux/workflow.yml`. Whether the queue is
//! *enabled* is policy that slice E's `merge_queue_status()` MCP tool reports;
//! what this answers is the narrower question the chrome actually asks — "is
//! there a queue here, and what is in it right now" — and the honest answer for
//! a repo that never enabled the feature is [`status = "absent"`](project),
//! because no `merge_queue.json` was ever written. One file, one read.
//!
//! # Three properties this file exists to hold
//!
//! 1. **No state renders as unknown or blank.** `mergeq::EntryState` has no
//!    catch-all variant on purpose, so a state word this build does not know
//!    fails the parse — and that failure is projected as a *loud* `unreadable`
//!    status carrying the parser's own message, never as an empty queue. An
//!    empty queue and an unreadable one look identical to a human, which is
//!    exactly why they must not share a wire shape.
//! 2. **Truncation is surfaced, never silent** (the #608/#579 convention).
//!    `entries_total` is the count in the *file* and `truncated` is reported by
//!    the reader that knows it cut something — the `audit_log_windowed`
//!    precedent — so a capped list can never read as a complete one.
//! 3. **A version this build does not understand is refused, not guessed at.**
//!    Unknown *fields* are tolerated (that is `MergeQueueState`'s job); an
//!    unknown *schema* means the fields this build recognizes may no longer
//!    mean what it thinks, and rendering them anyway would put a confident
//!    wrong sentence in front of a human.
