// so the "Approve cannot succeed, say so up front" rule (#316's design ask 1)
// has one place that decides it instead of each caller re-deriving it.

// The gate is a property of the CURRENT SESSION, not any one PR's provenance
// (doc/design/workflows.md, "a gate lives and dies with the toggle that
// authorized it") — so every function here reads the live `WorkflowStatus`,

/** Whether clicking Approve on `task` can actually result in a merge. A human
 *  Approve grant is the human merge gate, not the reviewer-consensus one
 *  (#197/#222) — it never opens an armed workflow gate — so this is `false`
 *  whenever a gate is armed and the task carries a PR, regardless of whether
 *  the gate is (today) satisfiable. `reason` is short enough for a button
 *  label; call `gateExitsMessage()` for the longer tooltip.
 *
 *  THE REASON IS THREE-WAY on the PR's base branch (#581), and the branching is
 *  about accuracy, never about permission — `ok` is `false` in all three cases
 *  and no merge is opened by any of them:
 *
 *  - **base unknown** (no `pr_base` recorded, or no resolved `default_branch`
 *    to compare it against) → the conservative default-branch wording. Every
 *    pre-#581 task is in this case, and so is any board whose orchestrator
 *    doesn't record the field.
 *  - **base IS the default branch** → the same wording, now actually earned.
 *  - **base is some other branch** (a sub-PR into an integration branch) → says
 *    so, and names it. The old text ("won't merge — gate needs …") implied the
 *    human's grant is what this PR is waiting on; it isn't. The human gate is
 *    default-branch-only (the shim `exec`s a non-default merge straight
 *    through), so what actually holds a sub-PR is the workflow gate's verdicts.
 *
 *  What does NOT change: the gate applies to EVERY merge of the PR wherever it
 *  lands (shim property 2), so an unsatisfiable gate still outranks all of this,
 *  and `pr_base` is agent-written display metadata that nothing enforces on.
 *
 *  The wrong-in-the-reassuring-direction case — a merge into the default branch
 *  labelled a harmless sub-PR — is what the comparison below is arranged to
 *  avoid, but it is REDUCED, not eliminated (rev-157 NB1). Two known residuals
 *  survive: `default_branch` is resolved from local refs, so a clone that never
 *  fetched a remote default-branch rename compares against the old name; and
 *  `pr_base` is agent-written, so a value in some vocabulary neither side
 *  expects reads as "a different branch". Nothing gates on either — the shim
 *  resolves base and default live at merge time — so the cost of both is a
 *  misleading sentence, never an authorization. */
