// Merge-queue visibility (#581 slice F) — DOM-free derivations over the
// `orch_merge_queue` payload (orchestration.ts) for the lifecycle chrome.
//
// Design note: docs/design/merge-queue.md. §4 defines the eight entry states,
// §11.3 the `merge_queue.json` schema the payload projects, §11.6 this surface.
// This module never fetches, never renders, and never decides anything about
// the queue: the queue is host-run (§3), and the frontend's whole role is to
// say, accurately, what it is doing.
//
// Three rules, each of which is a test in test/mergequeue.test.ts:
//
// 1. **Every state the core defines renders as itself.** All eight get a label
//    and a tone here; none renders blank, and none renders as "unknown".
// 2. **A ninth state fails LOUD.** `entryStateLabel` throws
//    `UnknownMergeQueueState` rather than inventing a word for it. A state this
//    build does not know can only mean the backend moved under an older
//    frontend, and a made-up label ("unknown", "—", or worse, a plausible
//    neighbour) is a confident wrong sentence in front of a human deciding
//    whether their PR is stuck. The caller catches it into a loud row; what it
//    must never do is degrade quietly.
// 3. **Truncation is surfaced, never silent** (the #608 convention). Both cuts
//    — the backend's wire cap and this module's row cap — end up in one honest
//    note that names how many of how many are shown.
