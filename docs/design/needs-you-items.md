# Needs-you items — the thing waiting on the human, as a record

*#1151. This note covers slice A — the item entity, the per-group registry, the
board lifecycle mapping, the clear-completed watermark, and the trusted Tauri
commands — and slice B, the MCP surface an agent reaches them through. It also covers
slice C's panel, which reads both registries into one list. It is the companion to
[human-questions.md](human-questions.md), which owns the other half of the same
panel.*

## The problem

Before this, the NEEDS-YOU panel's DEMOS tier was a **pure projection** of
`tasks.json`: every row whose status was demo-gated (`prototype`,
`human-testing`) became a panel entry, and that entry *was* the task. It had no
record of its own.

Three things follow from that, and all three are the complaint:

- **No lifecycle.** There is no "I have seen this". The only close-out available
  is a board move, so acknowledging a demo and *deciding* about it are the same
  gesture — and a human who has looked but not decided has nowhere to put that.
- **No identity and no timestamps.** Nothing says who asked for the look, when,
  or why this one is urgent and that one is not. The panel could sort by board
  order and nothing else.
- **No way to ask about anything that is not a board row.** "What do you think of
  this direction?" has no status to park in, so it was not askable at all.

## The shape

**A needs-you item is a first-class record that LINKS a task rather than being
one.** `needs-you.json` lives in the group dir beside `questions.json` and
`tasks.json`; `needsyou::Item` owns *who raised it, when, what for, and
open/resolved*. Everything else — `demo_path`, `pr`, `assignee`, whether Proceed
is available — is **joined live from `tasks.json` at render**.

That split is the whole design. Snapshotting a task's fields onto an item would
create a second record about board state that starts drifting the moment the
board moves, which is exactly the shape the old DEMOS projection (#1091 slice C,
which #1151 slice C replaced) already had. The item owns the *ask*; the task keeps owning the *facts*.

```
needs-you.json   ── item n-3 ──link──▶  tasks.json ── t-12
  who asked                              title, status, pr, demo_path,
  when                                   assignee, canProceed
  what for
  open / resolved (+ by whom, when)
```

### Why not fold it into `questions.json`

`questions.json` is a shipped public contract with a purpose-built trust
boundary — a closed `AnswerSource`, two boundary tests, a documented "every agent
may ask, no agent may ever answer" argument. And *answering* a question is a
different power from *resolving* an item: an answer settles a decision the human
was asked and releases the work waiting on it, while a resolve says "I have
looked". Entangling them would widen the one surface #946 spent three layers
keeping narrow, and would mean migrating a live file that is holding decisions
nobody has made yet.

So the panel becomes **one surface over two registries** rather than one registry
plus one projection. `question` is deliberately not an item `kind`.

### Why not "attention"

`AttentionItem` is already the pane-chip scan's type, with a frontend mirror in
`src/attention.ts`. Calling this "attention" would make every reader
disambiguate. The module keeps its own vocabulary behind `needsyou::`, the way
`humanq::` does, for the same reason.

## Public contracts this ships

### `needs-you.json`

An array of item records in the group dir. Every field past the required core
carries `#[serde(default)]`, so a file written by an older build loads.

| field | notes |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | `n-1`, `n-2`, … — minted off the file's own high-water mark |
| `kind` | `demo` \| `feedback` — a closed set |
| `raiser` | agent id, or `board` for an auto-raised item |
| `text` | what to look at / what is wanted back (cap `ITEM_TEXT_MAX`, 2000) |
| `task` | the linked board row. **Required for `demo`**, optional for `feedback` |
| `urgency` | `normal` \| `high` — the same `humanq::Urgency`, reused not re-declared |
| `status` | `open` \| `resolved` |
| `created_ms` | |
| `resolved_ms`, `resolved_by`, `resolution` | present once settled. `resolution` is the human's words about the close: a note when they resolved, a REASON when they dismissed (#2137) — `resolved_by` says which |

**`task` is required for a demo and optional for feedback** (#1151 decision D4).
The panel opens the board row to show what to run, so a demo with nothing linked
is a demo nobody can reach; a feedback ask can legitimately precede any row.

**`urgency` is the same type questions use**, imported rather than cloned. The
panel unions items and questions into one list and sorts it urgency-first, so two
identical enums would be two spellings of one word that the sort then has to
reconcile.

**`status` has two states, not four.** A withdrawal, a board move and (since
#2137) the human's dismissal are *resolutions with a different `resolved_by`*,
not statuses of their own — unlike `humanq::Status`, which does carry a
separate `withdrawn` and a separate `dismissed`. The asymmetry is deliberate: a
question's terminal states differ in whether the human's decision was ever
obtained, which every reader needs; an item's do not — nobody decided anything,
the row is closed, and the provenance lives in `resolved_by` for whoever cares
exactly.

**#2137 is where that argument was tested, and it is a deliberate deviation
from the issue as written.** The issue asked for "a new terminal state" on both
registries, and the question side got exactly that. Adding one here would have
meant a `dismissed` status whose entire content was a `resolved_by` this file
already carries — a second field with the same job, contradicting the paragraph
above for no reader's benefit, and starting the drift where a reader has to
check two fields to learn one fact. So the item side expresses a dismissal as
`ResolveSource::WebviewDismiss`, writing `resolved_by: "dismissed:webview"` —
the fourth tag in a column that already had three. The deviation was raised
before the code was written and approved; what a reader gets is unchanged
(a dismissal is readable as such, for ever, from one field), and what they are
spared is a second place to look.

**Ids are legible, not opaque.** `n-{highest + 1}`, read off the file exactly as
`q-N` and `t-N` are. Constraint 2 (no getrandom-based crates) is satisfied
because no crate is involved, and unpredictability would buy nothing: the id is
never a capability — the only surfaces that can act on one are trusted — and it
*is* quoted in a pane notice, where legibility is load-bearing. Ids are never
reused: retention only ever drops rows below the high-water mark that produced
them.

**Reads are loud about a bad file.** `OrchRegistry::needs_you` treats an absent
file as empty and *every other failure as an error*, `questions()`'s posture for
its reason: every mutation is a read-modify-write of the whole file, so a read
that answered "no items" for a file it merely failed to parse would let the very
next raise overwrite it. (`orch_needs_you_list` still shows an empty list — it
has no error channel and its caller renders one.)

**Retention.** Resolved rows are capped in the file at `RESOLVED_RETAINED` (20),
oldest-*raised* out first; the audit log keeps all of them. Open rows are **never**
pruned at any count — `OPEN_MAX` (32) bounds them by refusing new raises instead,
loudly, because reaching it means things are being queued for a human faster than
any human works through them.

### The `needs-you-cleared` marker

A file in the group dir containing a decimal ms timestamp: the clear-completed
watermark. The panel hides any **settled** row (a resolved item, an answered or
withdrawn question) stamped at or before it.

**Clearing is not deleting, and not a row mutation.** `clear_needs_you` never
opens `needs-you.json` at all. That is what makes "clears the UI, persists on
disk" structural rather than a promise, and it is why an open row can never be
affected: there is nothing in the path that could touch one. The choice survives
a restart, which is why it is a marker file rather than session state — the
`set_notify` precedent, under the same `marker_io` lock so two clears cannot land
their writes in the opposite order to the stamps they minted.

The rejected alternative was a `cleared: true` flag written onto settled rows.
That mutates two files' contracts (items *and* questions) where one watermark
suffices, and it turns "hide what I have seen" into a write against the file
holding what the human has *not* seen.

**Unparseable reads as `0`, deliberately the opposite fail direction from the
items file.** A misread items file that came back empty would let the next write
destroy open items; a misread watermark that comes back `0` shows a settled row
the human had already cleared. One loses a record, the other costs a click — so
the watermark fails toward showing *more*, never toward hiding.

### Tauri commands

| command | set | notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `orch_needs_you_list(group_id)` | orch-read | items + `cleared_ms` + the board rows the open items name, in one round trip |
| `orch_needs_you_resolve(group_id, id, note?)` | orch-control | the human's close-out |
| `orch_needs_you_dismiss(group_id, id, reason?)` | orch-control | the human's *no longer relevant* (#2137) |
| `orch_needs_you_clear(group_id)` | orch-control | stamps the watermark, returns it |

All four parse `group_id` at the boundary through `command_group` (CLAUDE.md
constraint 6), like every sibling command. Membership is enforced by *which file
was read*: each group's items live in its own group dir, so another group's id is
simply absent and gets the same refusal an id that never existed does.

`orch_needs_you_list` returns rows **and** the watermark together, rather than
leaving the panel to fetch two things: it hides settled rows against the
watermark, so two reads would let it render this second's rows against last
second's stamp and flash back a row the human had just cleared. It returns the
whole file, uncapped, for `orch_questions_list`'s reason — retention already
bounds it, and a cap whose size the caller cannot see is the silent truncation
the rest of this feature refuses.

Since #1317 it carries the **board rows its open items name** on the same read,
for the same argument one step further: the panel used to fetch the whole board
separately to answer `linkTask`'s point lookups, which both held a second copy
of a mostly-historical board and let a row and the item naming it come from two
parses a moment apart. One row per distinct task an OPEN item names, and no
others — the settled tail never joins the board. See
docs/design/polled-payload-shapes.md §3.

**It is a pure read.** It writes nothing, takes no lock, and must stay that way:
§5.4 of `remote-engine-protocol.md` classifies it `viewer`, and that tier is
defined as "cannot write a file". The upgrade migration used to run here; see
[the migration](#the-one-shot-migration) for why that was wrong twice over.

### MCP tools

Three, and the count is the point: `request_attention` raises, `withdraw_attention`
takes back, `list_needs_you` reads. There is no fourth, because the fourth would be
resolve — see [The resolve boundary](#the-resolve-boundary).

| tool | tier | notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `list_needs_you()` | every role | `{ items, omitted_resolved }`, `AgentItem` rows |
| `request_attention(kind, text, task?, urgency?)` | orchestrator | returns `n-N`; deduped `demo` returns the existing id |
| `withdraw_attention(id)` | orchestrator | settles `withdrawn:<agent>` |

**The read is shared and the writes are not**, which is `list_questions`' split and
one argument more. The panel unions the two registries, so an agent that could read
only half of what is waiting on the human would be reasoning about a queue the human
does not see; and a delegate reading that a demo it is about to ask for is already
parked is the opposite of a leak.

**Both writes are orchestrator-only, and this is a deliberate departure from the
plan** (#1151, plan-861), which specified `require_orchestrator_or_liaison` for the
raise by analogy with `ask_human`. [liaison.md](liaison.md) states a trip-wire on the
`liaison` hint: the two widenings it has (`group_usage`, `ask_human`) hang off the
root *"a liaison faces the human"*, and *"a THIRD tool on the second root is the
trigger, and the next one that is a write is the trigger regardless of count … the
answer then is the fifth kind, deliberately, not a longer table."* Raising an item is
both clauses at once — third tool, second write — and the fifth kind now exists:
`Role::Manager` (#1161), whose own definition cites this trip-wire as its reason.

So the human-facing pane's raise belongs to the manager's enumerated tool surface
(#1161 M2/M4), not to a third row on the liaison's table. The asymmetry is also the
cheap direction: widening this later is one word at one call site, while narrowing a
shipped grant is a contract break. liaison.md carries the same decision in its own
enumeration, so neither note can drift into claiming the widening happened.

**`request_attention` checks that `task` names a live board row, and that check lives
at the tool rather than in the registry.** `validate_raise` is pure and deliberately
board-blind: for the hook and the migration the check would have nothing to catch
(both supply the id of a row they have just read), and for an agent it catches a
dangling link.

**What a phantom id actually costs, and it is not the same for the two kinds.**
Both lose the LINK: the panel joins the task live to show what to look at, so the
human gets a card pointing at nothing. A `demo` loses more — it also loses any way
to settle on its own, because the auto-resolve filters `is_open_demo_for` and so
fires only for a demo item and only on a real row's transition. A `feedback` item
is **never** auto-resolved, however real its task; it ends when the human resolves
it or the raiser withdraws it. So the check is justified by the link for both
kinds, and additionally by the settle for `demo` — an earlier draft of this
paragraph gave only the settle reason, which implied a feedback item with a good
task would eventually clear itself. Pushing the check down into `raise_needs_you` would
mean reading `tasks.json` from inside the items lock, the nesting `needs_you_lock`
rules out in the other direction; so the tool reads the board first, then raises.

**The raise reply says which of the two things happened.** A deduped raise keeps the
existing row's text and discards the new ask's, and that is invisible in a bare id —
so the arm branches on `Raised::fresh` and, on a dedupe, says the words were not
stored and points at `kind: "feedback"` for an ask that is genuinely something else.

**What the tools do NOT get.** No `resolve`, at any tier. No `clear` — the watermark
is a fact about the human's view, and an agent hiding rows from the human's own panel
is the inverse of this feature. No `task` back-reference write: an item links a task,
never the other way round.

### What an agent reads

**Never a stored `Item`.** `project_list` — the projection behind slice B's
`list_needs_you` — returns `needsyou::AgentItem`, an explicitly enumerated
struct built field-by-field from `&Item` with **no `..` spread and no derive**.
That is the point of it: adding a field to `Item` must not be able to put that
field on an agent surface by itself. Whole-struct serialization onto an agent
surface is the class that failed on #1160, and this struct is what it costs to
pre-empt it.

| shown | withheld |
| --- | --- |
| `id`, `kind`, `raiser`, `text`, `task`, `urgency`, `status`, `created_ms`, `resolved_ms`, `resolved_by` | `resolution` — the human's verbatim close-out note |
| `had_resolution` — that a note exists | |

`resolved_by` is shown deliberately: an orchestrator must be able to tell "the
human looked" from "the board moved on" from "I withdrew this myself", which is
the whole reason those three tags stay distinguishable.

**Withholding `resolution` diverges from the `humanq` precedent, where the shared
`list_questions` returns the human's verbatim answer — and the divergence is the
decision, argued in full in
[human-questions.md](human-questions.md)'s "items vs. questions" comparison table.**
In one line: text written *to* an agent reaches it, text written *about* the
human's own queue is not broadcast. An answer is instructions addressed to the
asker and work is held pending it; a resolution note is the human annotating
their own queue while clearing it, the note already reaches the orchestrator's
pane through `resolve_notice`, and the only thing declined is putting it on a
read every delegate may call. Reviewed and settled as-is: coming out of #1160,
"the other registry is wider" is not a reason to loosen an agent surface when the
other registry's payload is functionally different.

The assertion that polices this is on the **serialized** form, not the struct: a
field present in Rust but absent from the wire would pass a field-by-field check
and still leak.

### `orch-needs-you-changed`

Emitted from `write_needs_you`, the single mutation point — so, the single
notification point, the `orch-tasks-changed` / `orch-questions-changed` shape. The
panel is the listener (`decisionsview.ts`, #1151 slice C).

### Audit actions

`needs-you-open`, `needs-you-resolve`, `needs-you-withdraw`, `needs-you-clear`,
and `needs-you-reject`. The reject line carries the op and the reason
(`unknown-item`, `already-resolved`, `invalid-resolution`, `raise-refused`,
`unreadable`, `unwritable`), which is what makes a refusal — or a best-effort
hook that could not do its job — visible rather than merely silent.

## The resolve boundary

An item is settled four ways, and they are deliberately not one operation:

| how | `resolved_by` | who can do it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| the human acknowledges | `webview` | the trusted Tauri command only |
| the human dismisses (#2137) | `dismissed:webview` | the trusted Tauri command only |
| the raiser takes it back | `withdrawn:<agent>` | the orchestrator, through `withdraw_attention` |
| the board moves on | `board:<new-status>` | the lifecycle hook |

**There is no MCP resolve or dismiss, and `ResolveSource` is a closed enum
supplied by the entry point.** Both are the human clearing their own attention
queue — the same no-self-served-gate boundary answering a question has, and the
same structural enforcement: `orch_needs_you_resolve` hard-codes
`ResolveSource::Webview` and `orch_needs_you_dismiss` hard-codes
`ResolveSource::WebviewDismiss`, rather than either taking a `source` string, so
"resolve as the human" has no spelling and neither does "dismiss as the human";
no `call_tool` arm reaches either method. An agent that wants its own ask gone
has `withdraw_attention`, which settles it *visibly* as a withdrawal.

**Adding `WebviewDismiss` widened no boundary.** It is the same party — the
human, in loomux's own webview — saying something different, so it adds no
surface, only a second thing the surface loomux already trusted can say. The
guard is that no AGENT-shaped variant exists, and none does.

That is why the board's auto-resolve and an agent's withdraw are **not**
`ResolveSource` variants. Both are weaker settles that write their own tags;
giving either one a `ResolveSource` would let it be mistaken for a human's
acknowledgement, which is the one thing this column exists to keep unambiguous.
The two human variants keep that property between themselves too, which is what
makes them two variants rather than a boolean: they write different tags, and
`the_resolve_and_dismiss_tags_are_not_the_same_string` pins the difference
rather than the two literals, so a rename cannot collapse "I looked" into "I
declined to look" while every other check stays green.

**No settle ever deletes a row.** A withdrawn or board-resolved item stays on
disk so a human who was mid-look can see what happened to it.

**Resolving does not move the task.** It clears the attention row; the board keeps
whatever status it had. Proceed and Request-changes stay the board actions they
always were.

### The resolve notice

`[orrerix] the human resolved needs-you item n-N (t-M): <note>`, delivered through
the ordinary `deliver_to_orchestrator` path — **only when the resolve carried a
note**. A note-less resolve is the human tidying their own queue, and a pane
delivery per tidy is noise the orchestrator pays for on every turn.

Both the note and the task ref are untrusted text entering an `[orrerix]` line. The
human is trusted; the pane still cannot tell one line from another, so an
embedded newline would forge a second line reading as its own legitimate notice.
The task ref is worse — nothing validates the string an ask attached to its item,
so it is raiser-controlled. Both go through `sanitize_gh_text`; only the id is
loomux-built, and it is emitted first so the cap trims the note's tail rather
than the attribution.

**A delivery failure never fails the resolve.** The item is settled durably
either way, and a cold orchestrator finds it through the list. The registry is
the record; the notice is only a notification.

### The dismissal notice (#2137)

```
[orrerix] needs-you item n-N (t-M) dismissed by the human — NOT A LOOK: they
did not open it, nothing was judged, and the task is exactly where it was. Do
not raise this ask again unless something changed. — reason: <reason>
```

(one line on the wire; wrapped here to fit the page).

**It is delivered whether or not there is a reason**, and that is the one place
dismissing behaves differently from resolving. A note-less resolve is the human
tidying a queue *after looking*, and a pane delivery per tidy is noise the
orchestrator pays for on every turn. A dismissal says the ask was not worth
opening — which is news to the agent that raised it, and the only signal it
will ever get. Suppressing it would mean the same ask comes back.

The fixed clause precedes the reason for the question notice's reason: the
words that stop this being read as "the human looked and approved" are
loomux-built, so the cap can only ever trim a reason's tail. Both the reason
and the task ref are untrusted text and go through `sanitize_gh_text`, exactly
as the resolve notice's note and task ref do.

**Dismissing does not move the task**, exactly as resolving does not.

That is three separate methods on the registry rather than one with flags —
`resolve_needs_you`, `dismiss_needs_you`, `withdraw_needs_you` — because each
differs in the tag it writes, the audit action it records, and whether it
delivers at all. A boolean threaded through one method would have made all
three of those conditionals inside a function whose callers could not see them.

**The split needs a guard, and review round 2 found it missing.** Both settle
methods take a `ResolveSource` by value while each hard-codes its own tag,
audit action and delivery rule — so the mismatched pairing
(`resolve_needs_you(…, WebviewDismiss)`) wrote `resolved_by:
"dismissed:webview"`, which every reader downstream treats as *the human did
not look*, while auditing `needs-you-resolve` and, with no note, delivering
nothing at all. Each method now refuses the other's source via
`ResolveSource::is_dismissal`, and
`a_resolve_and_a_dismissal_each_refuse_the_other_s_source` performs both
forbidden pairings rather than asserting the guard exists. Neither is reachable
from the two Tauri commands, each of which hard-codes one variant; the guard is
for the second dismissing surface, which is where an unguarded parameter gets
passed the wrong way.

## The board lifecycle mapping

**One hook, in `OrchRegistry::upsert_task`.** Every status transition already
funnels through it — `proceed_task`, `request_changes`, the board overlay and
every MCP `upsert_task` — so hanging the mapping there is what makes it
impossible to move a task into or out of the demo gate without the human's queue
following.

- **Into** `DEMO_GATED_STATUSES` → auto-raise a `demo` item, `raiser: "board"`.
- **Out of** it → auto-resolve that task's open demo item as
  `board:<new-status>`.

`DEMO_GATED_STATUSES` lives in `mod.rs` beside `MERGE_GATE_STATUSES`, mirroring
`src/taskboard.ts`'s `DEMO_STATUSES` the way `ensure_at_merge_gate` mirrors
`canApprove` — a backend copy rather than a read of the frontend's, because the
hook runs where no frontend exists. It is owned by the board and not by
`needsyou` for the reason `taskboard.ts`'s own comment gives for owning
`DEMO_STATUSES` rather than letting `decisions.ts` own it: which statuses park a
task is a fact about the board, and the registry is a consumer of it.
`the_backend_demo_gate_set_matches_the_boards` scans the TS declaration and
compares, so the two spellings cannot drift.

**The hook keys on the TRANSITION, not on the write.** A note appended to a task
that is already parked, an assignee edit, a shuffle between `prototype` and
`human-testing` — none of those crosses the boundary, so none of them raises or
resolves anything. That is what keeps it one human-visible row per parking rather
than one per board edit. `request_changes` is the concrete case: it appends a
note and leaves the status alone, so a demo item stays open through it, and
leaves the queue when the work actually moves.

**No duplication by construction** (#1151 decision D2). The dedupe lives in one
pure function, `needsyou::admit`: a `demo` raise for a task that already has an
open demo item returns the existing row rather than a second one, whether the
hook, the migration or an explicit `request_attention` asked. Dedupe runs *before*
the cap, so a duplicate raise stays idempotent even on a full queue — otherwise
the hook would start failing exactly when the backlog is worst. Feedback asks are
never deduped: two agents can legitimately want an opinion on one row.

**A deduped raise keeps the EXISTING row's text and discards the new ask's**, so
`admit` returns a `Raised { item, fresh }` rather than a bare item. For the hook
that bit is uninteresting; for a caller with an author to answer it is the
difference between "registered" and "there was already one of these, and your
words were not stored". `request_attention` reads that bit and branches its reply
on it, which is the whole reason it is returned.

**Both halves are best-effort against the board.** The board write has already
landed and cannot be unwound, so a raise refused by the cap, or an items file
that will not read, is audited as a `needs-you-reject` rather than turned into an
error that would make a successful board move look failed.

### The one-shot migration

A board already holding demo-gated rows when this ships has made its transitions
already, so without this every in-flight demo would silently vanish from the
panel on the release that adds the panel's own record. `migrate_demo_items`
synthesizes the missing rows.

**It is a migration, not a reconciliation, and that distinction is the design.**
The first cut ran it on every read and deduped on open rows only. That was
actively wrong, because resolving a demo item deliberately does *not* move the
task: the task was still demo-gated one refresh later, so the next read minted a
replacement row under a new id. The human's close-out came back — and again on
every subsequent resolve, and the same for an agent's withdrawal. A read that
reconciles the item file against the board can only ever fight the human.

Framed as a migration the question is well posed — "did this group exist before
the registry did?" — asked once, answered once, never changing. Two mechanisms
enforce it:

1. **The `needs-you-migrated` marker**, written even when nothing was added
   (`already considered` and `found nothing to do` are the same answer for every
   run after the first). Without it, every group resume would re-run.
2. **`Dedupe::EverRaised`** — for the migration, *any* demo row for the task,
   settled or not, is proof the registry has already seen it. A raise uses
   `Dedupe::OpenEpisode` instead, because there a settled row is a closed episode
   and a re-parked task genuinely deserves a new one. The two scopes are a named
   enum rather than a bool precisely so the difference cannot be lost again.

**They are belt-and-braces, not one guard and one decoration — and the precise
claim is worth stating, because the loose one ("both are load-bearing") is what
this paragraph first said and it is not true.** Either alone prevents the
resurrection in the ordinary case; each covers a case the other does not:

- Remove `EverRaised` alone and the ordinary case still holds, because the marker
  means the migration is never reconsidered. What breaks is the case where the
  marker is *absent while items already exist* — reachable, not hypothetical: the
  unreadable-file branch returns without writing the marker, and the group stays
  live and keeps raising through the hook, so the next load re-runs the migration
  against a file that already holds settled rows.
- Remove the marker alone and the ordinary case still holds too, because
  `EverRaised` reads the settled row as accounted for. What breaks is cost and
  noise, not correctness: every resume re-reads and re-considers the whole board.

Each guard has a test that isolates it, and the isolation is *measured* rather
than argued — the first draft of this paragraph asserted a split the runs did not
show, which is the failure mode the "run the mutation and see which tests redden"
rule exists for:

- `the_migration_does_not_resurrect_a_settled_row_even_without_its_marker`
  isolates `EverRaised`: it deletes the marker itself, so the marker neuter is a
  no-op for it, and it reddens on the `EverRaised` neuter **alone**.
- `the_marker_stops_the_migration_reconsidering_a_board_that_changed_later`
  isolates the marker, on the one observable `EverRaised` cannot mask — a board
  that gains a demo-gated row by a legacy path *after* the first load is
  deliberately not picked up, because the migration answered once and the hook
  owns everything since.

The two whole-flow resurrection tests redden only with the read path restored as
well, so they evidence the composite behaviour rather than either guard alone;
that is stated here rather than glossed, because a red evidences the assertion it
reached and no more.

**It runs at group load**, beside the pause / notify / autonomy marker re-seeds
it resembles — never on a read. That is what keeps `orch_needs_you_list` an
honest `viewer`-tier command: a peer holding only read rights must not be able to
drive a file write, an event emission and audit growth by polling. A group whose
panel can be open has been through that load path this session, so the trigger is
not weaker than the read was.

Re-parking is not this mechanism's job and never was: the transition hook already
gives a task that leaves and re-enters the gate a fresh row, which is pinned
separately.

## Concurrency

`needs_you_lock` serializes every read-modify-write of the file, a leaf of its
own like `questions_lock`.

**One documented nesting: `tasks_lock` → `needs_you_lock`, never the reverse.**
`upsert_task` keeps the board lock across the hook so that a task's status and
its demo item cannot settle in opposite orders under two racing transitions — an
in-then-out landing as out-then-in would leave an open demo item on a task that
is no longer parked, which is precisely the stale row the auto-resolve exists to
prevent. Nothing takes `tasks_lock` while holding `needs_you_lock`: the migration
reads the board through `tasks()`, which is a lock-free file read, and does so
*before* acquiring the items lock, so the nesting cannot cycle.

Also taken under the guard, both leaves and both the same nesting `tasks_lock`
already has: `AUDIT_LOCK` on the refusal paths, and the app-handle mutex on every
successful write (the event emit). The resolve path's success audit and its pane
delivery both happen **after** the guard is dropped — an audit write is cheap, a
delivery enqueues.

## Alternatives rejected

1. **One registry absorbing questions.** Migrating a live public contract, and
   entangling `resolve` with the answer trust boundary. See above.
2. **Keep demos as a projection, bolt a "dismissed ids" list beside it.** That is
   a second record *about task state* — the drift shape the projection was
   written to avoid — and it still gives items no identity, no raiser and no
   timestamps.
3. **`cleared: true` flags on settled rows** instead of a watermark. Mutates two
   files' contracts where one marker suffices.
4. **New task statuses for attention.** The exact model being rejected: it makes
   the ask a property of the work item again, which is where this started.

## What this note's slices do and do not reach

**Reaches:** the entity, the registry and its caps, the lifecycle hook and
one-shot migration, the watermark, the three Tauri commands and their ACL grants, the
audit actions, the event — and (slice B) the three MCP tools an agent reaches the
registry through.

**The panel is slice C (#1188), and it has landed** — `decisionsview.ts` listens
for `orch-needs-you-changed` and renders one unified list over both registries,
and the old DEMOS projection is gone. So the three surfaces this note describes
are all live, and a reader should treat the whole note as shipped behaviour
rather than as a design still arriving in pieces.

**Does not reach, and is not silently missing:**

- **The sort** (#1151 decision D1, urgency-pinned then newest-first) is the
  panel's, not this projection's. `project_list` returns open rows in raise order
  and a newest-first resolved tail; sorting here would put a second, weaker
  ordering in the way of the union sort the panel does anyway.
