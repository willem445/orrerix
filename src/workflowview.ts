// The WORKFLOW pane (#222, restructured by #880): the repo's workflow file, made configurable.
//
// ONE buffer, and the buffer is the FILE (the Kestra pattern — an inspector edit rewrites the
// YAML under the hood; the YAML is never a stale export of some hidden canvas state). What
// changed with #880 is not the model, it is the SHAPE OF THE SCREEN:
//
//   ┌────────────┬───────────────────────────────┬──────────────┐
//   │  roster    │  the canvas (primary surface) │  inspector   │
//   │  (blocks,  │  ── or the raw YAML, which is │  (whatever   │
//   │   gate)    │     a toggle over the same    │   is         │
//   │            │     space)                    │   selected)  │
//   └────────────┴───────────────────────────────┴──────────────┘
//
// The canvas is the primary surface and the inspector is DOCKED beside it, because the thing
// #880 was opened about is that clicking a block did not visibly do anything: the property form
// lived behind a "Blocks" tab, the canvas behind a "Graph" tab, and so selecting something and
// showing it were two separate acts — of which the canvas performed only the first. Docking the
// editor removes the second act rather than remembering to perform it. The roster stays as the
// left column (it is also the keyboard/accessibility path to every selection), and the raw YAML
// stays first-class as a toggle over the canvas: it is a different modality over the same file,
// not a lesser one, and the file remains the source of truth.
//
// The canvas EDITS the file (#222 v2 — it was read-only in v1 and the human asked for more). It
// draws the declared happy path (ADVISORY edges: the orchestrator still schedules) and the merge
// gate (ENFORCED: the `gh` shim refuses a merge until the named reviewers' verdicts are PASS),
// and the two are drawn differently BECAUSE they mean different things. Every gesture goes out
// through the same pure model as a form edit, so it can never become a second source of truth.
//
// All the thinking lives in the pure `workflowmodel.ts` (parse / serialize / validate / derive)
// and `workflowpane.ts` (the pane's own decisions — which surface, what the inspector shows),
// which is where the tests are. This file is DOM: rendering, focus, dialogs, and the read/write
// path through the hash-guarded `ft*` file commands.
//
// The one rule the sync has to obey: while the YAML does not PARSE, the inspector is disabled.
// An inspector edit serializes the model back over the buffer, and serializing a model we only
// half-understood would silently destroy the broken text the human is in the middle of
// fixing. So a syntax error disables the editor and says why; every other kind of breakage
// (an unknown kind, a dangling edge) still renders — as a stub, with a finding — because
// a block you cannot see is a block you cannot repair.

/** A name an edge mentions that no block answers to. Dashed, unmovable, unconnectable — it is
 *  not a block, it is the ABSENCE of one, and it disappears the moment the file stops
 *  mentioning it.
 *
 *  It still ANSWERS a rubber band held over it (rev-lead round 1, N3), because it is a drop
 *  target — it sits in `dropRects()` with the same in-port tolerance a real node has — and a
 *  target that stays dark while you hover it and then refuses on release is the quiet half of
 *  the same broken promise #1387 is about. The answer is only ever "no": `dropError` asks
 *  `connectionError` about a name no block answers to, which cannot return null (pinned in
 *  test/workflowmodel.test.ts, "an edge that would be nonsense is refused before it is
 *  drawn"). So there is no `wf-drop-ok` rule for a ghost, and no in-port dot either — a dot
 *  sitting there permanently would offer a connection that can never be made. */
