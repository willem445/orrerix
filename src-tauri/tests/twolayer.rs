//! The two-layer shape for agent-authored prose (#1968): a short human layer
//! first, the evidence collapsed in an agent layer below it.
//!
//! What this file can pin is the SHAPE of the instruction, not the prose an
//! agent writes from it — nothing here measures a PR body, and nothing can.
//! What it does pin is that the two templates which dictate a body's shape
//! still TELL an agent to write both layers, and that the collapsible's
//! `<summary>` is one canonical string across every shipped template rather
//! than N paraphrases: a human learns one affordance, a `grep` finds every
//! fold, and the squash-message cut has one line to look for.
//!
//! Integration tests, not unit tests, per CLAUDE.md constraint 4: a test
//! executable linking the full lib needs the comctl32-v6 manifest `build.rs`
//! embeds through `-tests`-scoped link args.
//!
//! **Default-deny, and decided on shapes rather than on names** (CLAUDE.md's
//! source-scanning-guard convention). [`every_fold_in_every_template_uses_the_one_canonical_wording`]
//! reads the templates directory off disk and judges any file that opens a
//! `<details>` or writes a `<summary>`, whatever it is called — a template
//! added tomorrow is covered without being listed here. The two REQUIRED rows
//! are named, and required exactly once each, so a rename fails loudly rather
//! than silently watching nothing.
//!
//! The third test covers the OTHER half of what an agent here reads: this
//! repo's own personas. Its population is not a list — it is derived from
//! `.orrerix/workflow.yml` through the REAL parser, so it is every worker- and
//! reviewer-kind block that declares a `profile:`. Change the roster and the
//! population follows; a persona that stops being read stops being required,
//! and one that starts being read is covered the day it is declared. That is
//! the same dogfood pin `tests/workflow/dogfood.rs` and `test/workflowdogfood.test.ts`
//! already make, asked of the prose rather than of the schema.
//!
//! **Residual, stated:** this is a scan over instruction text. It cannot see a
//! body an agent actually posts, and it does not bound prose LENGTH — the rule
//! it enforces is about what sits above the fold, never how much. Nor does it
//! reach a `prompt:` persona written inline in the workflow file, or a repo
//! that ships no workflow file at all: both are outside the population by
//! construction, and the third test says so where it skips them.
