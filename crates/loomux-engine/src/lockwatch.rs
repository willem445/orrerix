//! Instrumented mutexes (#1601, plan §3 Phase 0.1/0.2) — what was holding a
//! lock when the app stopped answering — and, since #1609 (Phase 2.1), a
//! bound on how long a waiter pays for it; and since #1610 (Phase 3a), a
//! runtime check that the order they are taken in is the order that was
//! declared.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Three betas in a row shipped a responsiveness fix derived from *reading*
//! code, and each relocated the symptom instead of removing it
//! (`docs/plans/responsiveness-root-cause.md` §1). The reason a reading was the
//! best evidence available is that plan's §2.3: a hang produces no artifact at
//! all. `obs` writes a crash log when the process dies, and a process wedged on
//! a mutex does not die — so the total evidence for the last three incidents
//! was a human saying "it froze".
//!
//! This module is the missing artifact. Phase 0 fixed nothing, bounded
//! nothing and changed no behaviour; it made the state a hang leaves behind
//! *reportable*, so the next remedy would be chosen against evidence instead
//! of against a story that fits.
//!
//! #1609 is that next remedy, and it lives here too because it is the same
//! object seen from the other side: [`TrackedMutex::lock_within`] and
//! [`Busy`] turn one waiter's unbounded park into a typed answer that NAMES
//! the holder the instrument above already knows about. The policy half —
//! the thread-local budget, [`crate::budget::MutationScope`] and the six
//! budget constants — is [`crate::budget`], and the contract both halves
//! publish is `docs/design/lock-liveness.md`.
//!
//! # The shape
//!
//! [`TrackedMutex`] is `parking_lot::Mutex` plus a small block of atomics,
//! and its [`lock_safe`](TrackedMutex::lock_safe) has the SAME signature as
//! [`crate::obs::LockExt::lock_safe`] — so the call sites in
//! `orchestration/mod.rs` are untouched and the migration was a type swap on
//! the registry's fields. (Phase 0 shipped it over std's `Mutex`; #1609
//! swapped the inner primitive for the one that has a timed acquire. The
//! one observable difference is poisoning, which parking_lot does not have
//! at all — see [`TrackedMutex`]'s own note for why that is the same
//! outcome `lock_safe`'s `into_inner` recovery already produced.)
//!
//! Two things are reported, and they are complementary rather than redundant:
//!
//! - **A hold that ENDED** past the threshold, with its exact total. The guard's
//!   `Drop` stamps it; [`drain_completed_holds`] composes and writes it. This
//!   cannot miss a completed hold, however briefly the watchdog happened to be
//!   looking elsewhere.
//! - **A hold STILL in flight** ([`LockWatch::tick`]). That is the case a drop
//!   can never report, and it is the beta6 case: a hold that never ends has no
//!   drop to run.
//!
//! Together they cover every hold past the threshold — one of the two always
//! fires, and neither depends on the other being wired.
//!
//! Both are *composed* on the watchdog thread ([`crate::selfwatch`]), and that
//! split is the point rather than an implementation detail: see
//! [`TrackedGuard::drop`].
//!
//! # What acquiring and releasing cost
//!
//! Both paths are a fixed number of atomic operations on this lock's own cache
//! line, one monotonic clock read, and — since #1610 — one push or pop on a
//! thread-local fixed array. There is **no allocation, no formatting, no global
//! lock and no syscall on either** — the global registry is touched at
//! CONSTRUCTION only, the held-lock stack is per-thread and never shared, and
//! every byte of every report is produced on the watchdog thread, with no
//! tracked lock held. See [`TrackedMutex::lock_safe`] and
//! [`TrackedGuard::drop`].
//!
//! A lock-ORDER finding (#1610) writes no file from the acquiring thread
//! either: it stamps one slot in atomics and the watchdog composes it, which
//! is the same split, for the same reason. See [`stamp_order_report`]. The
//! exceptions are the PANICS — the debug panic on an inversion, and (#1702) a
//! re-entrant acquisition's refusal in any build — because a panic runs `obs`'s
//! hook, and that writes a crash log while the outer lock is still held. Both
//! are threads that are leaving rather than continuing; see
//! [`TrackedMutex::refuse_reentrant`], which states the cost.
//!
//! It was not always so, and the reasoning that got it wrong is worth keeping.
//! The release path used to write its own report, excused by "a hold that has
//! already lasted seconds is not a hot path". That is true of the HOLDER and
//! false of everyone else: a hold long enough to report is precisely the one
//! with waiters queued behind it, so the file write landed on every waiter's
//! latency path — the path this whole plan is about (#1605 review B1).
//!
//! # Reading a hold coherently
//!
//! The holder publishes several fields that must be read as one record, and the
//! watchdog reads them from another thread without taking the mutex — taking it
//! would make the observer wait on exactly the thing it is observing, which is
//! the one behaviour a hang instrument may never have. So the fields are
//! published behind a generation counter (even = free, odd = held) in the
//! seqlock shape: the holder writes the fields, then publishes the generation
//! with a `Release` store; a reader takes the generation with `Acquire`, reads
//! the fields, and takes the generation again, discarding the sample if it
//! moved. The mutex itself serialises the writers, so there is exactly one
//! writer per generation and no CAS loop is needed.

// Lock ranks (#1610, plan §3 Phase 3a)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The epic's §3 opens on the thing this closes: 17 mutexes on one struct with
// **no declared lock order**, and `resolve_token`'s own comment saying why —
// "locking them together would pin a lock order no other call site promises to
// respect". Thirteen doc comments in `orchestration/mod.rs` DO state an order.
// A comment cannot fail a build, which is §2.2's whole finding about this
// repo's guard culture, so those thirteen claims are moved here as ranks and
// checked at run time.
//
// The check is per-THREAD and needs no second thread to fire: a cycle between
// two locks deadlocks only when two threads race, but the ordering FACT that
// permits it is visible on one thread the first time it takes them the wrong
// way round. That is why this finds inversions a soak test cannot — it does not
// need the race to happen, only the order.

/// The sentinel a lock built with [`TrackedMutex::new`] carries.
///
/// `u32::MAX` rather than `0`, so `LockRank::new(0)` stays a legal outermost
/// rank. Nothing ever COMPARES this value: every comparison below filters it
/// out explicitly, because "unranked" is an absence of an opinion rather than a
/// position in the order.
const UNRANKED: u32 = u32::MAX;

/// Where a lock sits in the registry's acquisition order.
///
/// **Smaller is OUTER.** A thread may take rank 500 while holding rank 100;
/// taking rank 100 while holding rank 500 is an inversion — the shape that
/// deadlocks the moment another thread does it the declared way round.
///
/// Sparse integers rather than an enum, on purpose: the table in
/// `orchestration::lockorder` leaves gaps between families so a new lock can be
/// slotted between two existing ones without renumbering. A renumbering touches
/// every const at once, and a diff in which every line changed is one no
/// reviewer can read for ORDER — the single property these values carry.
///
/// **Every ranked FIELD has a distinct rank**, which is load-bearing rather
/// than tidy. It makes "two held locks share a rank" mean "the same field, from
/// two different registries" — something a test process really does build,
/// several times per test — instead of "two peers that must never nest". So
/// re-entrancy is decided by lock IDENTITY (the registry id minted in
/// `LockState`), never by rank equality, and equal ranks nest freely.

    /// mean pushing a hold that may never happen. On release there is ONE
    /// access ([`pop_held`]) and a scan from the top of that array, which
    /// finds its own entry on the first comparison unless a guard was dropped
    /// out of order. The stack is per-thread, so none of it is a shared cache
    /// line and none of it can contend.

    /// No allocation, no formatting, no global lock, no syscall, and nothing that

    ///    into a silently-degraded read. A shipped build has no such choice to
    ///    make; a test build does, and the loud half is the point of arming it.

    ///    panic off: unwind to that frame with the [`BusyKind::Reentrant`]
    ///    `Busy`, which its owner already renders — an MCP `isError` saying
    ///    nothing was executed, a `partial` snapshot section, a command's empty
    ///    degrade. **This unwinds even when [`crate::budget::unwind_forbidden`]
    ///    holds**, which is the one narrowing of `lock-liveness.md` §4.1's
    ///    seal: the seal exists so a sealed frame WAITS rather than tearing a
    ///    durable write, and it is a good trade because waiting ends. Here it
    ///    does not end — the alternative to the tear is not "later", it is
    ///    "never" — and a tear is counted (`budget::torn_writes`) and
    ///    breadcrumbed where a wedge is neither.
    /// 3. **No frame** (a cadenced tick under `tick_gate`'s `MutationScope`, an
    ///    MCP mutate helper thread, a `run_blocking` body): the same panic as
    ///    (1). `obs`'s hook writes a crash log naming both sites, and the
    ///    unwind drops every guard on the way out, so the registry is RELEASED
    ///    — which is the whole point, and the one thing the park could never
    ///    do. Callers are supervised so the panic ends the tick rather than the
    ///    thread; see `obs::TickSupervisor`.
    ///
    /// **That third list is the threads on which an unwind is a DEGRADE, and it
    /// is not every no-frame caller** (#1713 review B1). A synchronous
