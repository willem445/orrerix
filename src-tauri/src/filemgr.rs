//! Native-style file MANAGER backend (issue #214).
//!
//! This is the Explorer/Finder/Nautilus equivalent, NOT the in-app editor: you
//! browse folders, and double-clicking a file hands it to **the OS default
//! application for its extension**. Loomux never opens it. That single sentence is
//! what separates this module from `fileedit` — which is the in-app editor
//! (`Alt+F`), still there, still unchanged, and deliberately not what a
//! file-explorer pane hosts.
//!
//! ## Path safety
//!
//! Every command takes a `root` (the pane's folder) and a `rel` *relative to it*,
//! and routes through `fileedit::safe_resolve` — the module's existing, tested
//! choke point (lexical `..` folding, no absolute `rel`, no traversal *through* a
//! symlink). It is reused rather than reimplemented on purpose: a second
//! path-validation implementation is a second one to get wrong, and this module
//! DELETES things. The webview is trusted, but these operations are destructive
//! and sit next to agent-facing surfaces, so the check is defense-in-depth exactly
//! as CLAUDE.md constraint #6 asks (`fileedit`'s own header makes the same
//! argument for reads and writes).
//!
//! On top of that, every *name* the user supplies (new folder, rename target) must
//! be a single plain path segment — `validate_name` rejects separators, `.`/`..`,
//! and the Windows reserved device names — so a rename can never relocate a file,
//! only re-label it.
//!
//! ## No new crates
//!
//! Two Windows Shell APIs from the `windows` crate we ALREADY depend on:
//!
//!   * `ShellExecuteW` — "open with the default app", exactly what Explorer's
//!     double-click does. It takes a path, never a shell string, so unlike
//!     `cmd /c start` there is nothing to re-parse and no injection surface.
//!   * `SHFileOperationW` with `FO_DELETE | FOF_ALLOWUNDO` — delete to the
//!     **Recycle Bin**, so a mis-click is recoverable.
//!
//! The `trash` crate would have covered the second, and `tauri-plugin-opener` the
//! first, but both are unvetted additions to a tree with a hard getrandom ban
//! (CLAUDE.md constraint #2 — `bcryptprimitives.dll!ProcessPrng` isn't exported on
//! this project's Windows 10 baseline, and the binary then fails to load with
//! 0xc0000139). Reaching for an API we already link sidesteps the question
//! entirely: `cargo tree -i getrandom` is unchanged by this module.
//!
//! On macOS/Linux the default-app open is `open`/`xdg-open` (spawned detached,
//! argv — never a shell string), and there is **no Recycle Bin**: delete is
//! permanent. `fm_delete_mode` reports which, so the confirmation dialog can say
//! what will actually happen instead of guessing.

/// Serializes the three MUTATING gestures this module moved off the webview
/// thread (#746): `new_folder`, `new_file`, `rename`.
///
/// **Why one of them needed it and the other two came along.** Two of the three
/// refuse-if-present checks are atomic in the filesystem itself and say so in
/// their own docs: `new_file`'s `create_new(true)` is called out as "the
/// load-bearing flag", with its `exists()` check explicitly demoted to "only
/// there for the nicer message", and `new_folder`'s `create_dir` is the same
/// refuse-if-present shape. `rename` is NOT: its clobber guard is a plain
/// `to.exists()` followed by `fs::rename`, and that gap was closed only by
/// Tauri running the sync command alone on the webview thread. Off-thread, two
/// renames racing for one target name — or a rename racing a create of it —
/// can both find the target absent, and `fs::rename` then overwrites without a
/// word (on Windows too: `MoveFileExW` with `MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING`). The
/// file that vanishes is the one the doc says a file manager must never lose to
/// a rename typo.
///
/// So the gate covers the *set*, not just `rename`: making one operation
/// exclusive against itself would still leave a `new_file` free to land inside
/// its check-then-rename window. Three single syscalls under one mutex costs
/// nothing anybody waits on, and it is exactly the exclusion dispatch used to
/// give for free.
///
/// **`fm_delete_start` is deliberately NOT here**, and that is not an
/// oversight: it has run on its own thread since #216, so a delete racing a
/// rename is a window this conversion did not open and this gate would not
/// close. Holding a shared mutex across `SHFileOperationW` over a
/// `node_modules`-sized tree would also block every create and rename for
/// minutes — trading a rare, pre-existing race for a routine freeze.

/// Test-only seam: hold [`MUTATION_GATE`] so a test can ask whether a gated
/// call actually parks on it.
///
/// **Why a seam rather than only the threaded race test.** The end-to-end race
/// test (`concurrent_renames_onto_one_target_leave_exactly_one_winner_and_lose_no_file`)
/// pins the real property — a file must not vanish — but its sensitivity is
/// platform-dependent, and measurably so: with the gate removed it reddened on
/// windows-latest (7 of 8 renames accepted) while ubuntu and macOS passed
/// 39/39, because the `to.exists()`-to-`fs::rename` window on a tmpfs tempdir
/// is narrower than thread wake-up skew. A pin that can only fail on one of
/// three platforms is not a pin on the other two.
///
/// So this seam backs it with a check that is deterministic everywhere: hold
/// the gate, call a gated function on another thread, and require that it has
/// NOT completed. A held mutex genuinely blocks, so the guarded case cannot
/// flake; an ungated call returns immediately, so the unguarded case cannot
/// pass. This is `performance.md` P3's own stated technique for a new lock that
/// matters — the one `tests/perf_leaflocks.rs` uses to park a read inside a

// directory enumeration nothing bounds, a `CreateDirectory`, a rename across a
// network share, an `explorer.exe` spawn and a BLOCKING `ShellExecuteW` all ran
// on the thread that services paint. `fm_delete_start` (§4 X2) and
// `fm_capabilities` (in-memory) are the two that stay sync, each for its own
// argued reason.
//
// **Reentrancy — the family argument, for the four filesystem gestures below.**
// Synchronous dispatch used to order them against each other, and the honest
// answer is that it was doing real work for ONE of them.
//
// `fm_list` is a read: it sees the directory on one side of a concurrent change
// or the other, which is all a listing has ever been — the agent in the pane can
// `mkdir` between the frontend's request and this walk, and always could.
//
// `fm_new_folder` and `fm_new_file` refuse an existing target in a SINGLE
// syscall, and each says so where it is implemented: `create_new(true)` is
// called out in `new_file`'s own doc as the load-bearing flag with its
// `exists()` check demoted to "only there for the nicer message", and
// `create_dir` (not `_all`) is the same refuse-if-present shape. Their
// atomicity was never this process's to provide, so the conversion does not
// touch it.
//
// `fm_rename` is the one that is NOT in that class, and the family argument
// would be wrong if it swept it in: its clobber guard is `to.exists()` followed
// by `fs::rename`, a check-then-act whose window was closed by nothing but the
// single dispatch thread. That is what [`MUTATION_GATE`] is for — see its doc
// for why the gate covers all three mutations rather than `rename` alone, and
// `concurrent_renames_onto_one_target_leave_exactly_one_winner_and_lose_no_file`
// in `tests/filemgr.rs` for the file it stops disappearing.

/// This is the part that made it worth deferring rather than rushing (rev-102, round 3).
/// A plain `async fn` command runs on Tauri's async runtime, on a thread pool whose COM
/// state is nobody's business — and `SHFileOperationW` is a **Shell/COM** API whose
/// apartment requirement the main thread was silently satisfying for us (wry
/// `OleInitialize`s it as an STA). Offloading it naively trades a freeze for an
/// apartment question. So this spawns a **dedicated OS thread** that enters its own STA
/// (`ComApartment`, above) for the duration and leaves it on the way out.
///
/// ## Why there is NO cancellation — deliberately
///
/// The other three streams on the shared id counter (search, name index, hashing) are all
/// cancellable, and this one is conspicuously not. That is a decision, not an oversight:
///
///   * `SHFileOperationW` is **one call**. It exposes no cancel handle, no progress sink,
///     and no way to ask it to stop. (`IFileOperation` does, via
///     `IFileOperationProgressSink` — a different, much larger API surface, and a
///     different conversation.)
///   * Even if it could be stopped, a delete cancelled halfway through a tree leaves a
///     **half-deleted directory** — some children in the Recycle Bin, some not, and a
///     parent that may or may not still exist. That is a worse outcome than waiting.
///
/// So a delete, once confirmed, runs to completion. The UI says *"Deleting…"* and does not
/// offer a Cancel button it could not honor. It does not register a flag in the cancel
/// registry either — a flag nobody polls is a lie told to the next reader.
///
/// Navigation and hashing stay live throughout: they touch nothing the delete owns, and
/// freezing them in the UI would reintroduce, one layer up, exactly the unresponsiveness
/// this change exists to remove.
