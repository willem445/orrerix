//! Durable whole-file replace (#133).
//!
//! One primitive: [`atomic_write`], the temp-file + fsync + rename that every
//! orchestration state file (`state.json`, `group.json`, `tasks.json`,
//! `queue.json`, the #83 grants) is stored through, plus the sequence counter
//! that keeps two concurrent writers' scratch files apart.
//!
//! It is here (#888 slice A3 batch 9) because durability is not a desktop
//! concern: `std::fs` only, no `tauri`, no pane, and a headless daemon writes
//! exactly the same files the app does. Through batch 9 it had no outward edge
//! at all — not even `lock_safe` — which is what let it move in the same batch
//! as [`crate::subproc`] without sharing anything with it. The two are
//! deliberately separate modules: a bounded subprocess capture and a crash-safe
//! file replace answer different failure modes and share no design story.
//!
//! **It has exactly one outward edge now** (#1609), and it is named here rather
//! than left for a reader to find in the body: [`atomic_write`] calls
//! [`crate::budget::note_durable_write`]. That is two thread-local reads and,
//! on the rare path, a breadcrumb — no lock, no wait, no new failure mode.
//!
//! It exists because this function is the durable **REPLACE** primitive: it
//! destroys the previous contents of a state file, so a bounded acquisition
//! that unwound after it would leave a world nothing else agrees with. The
//! call SEALS the surrounding budget frame, which is what makes that
//! impossible (`docs/design/lock-liveness.md` §4.1).
//!
//! **It is not the only durable-write door, and an earlier version of this
//! note said it was** (#1609 review B3). `append_audit` and
//! `append_ledger_line` in `orchestration/mod.rs` write state files too, by
//! append rather than replace, and deliberately do NOT seal — §4.3 carries
//! that line and the reason. The boundary argument above is untouched: still
//! `std::fs` only, still no `tauri`, still nothing a headless daemon cannot
//! link.
//!
//! **Deliberately no `tempfile`.** Uniqueness comes from a std atomic, which
//! keeps this clear of the getrandom-based crates the Windows 10 baseline
//! cannot load (CLAUDE.md constraint 2) — and this crate is linked into the
//! shipped Windows binary, so that ban applies on this side of the boundary
//! exactly as it does in `src-tauri`.
