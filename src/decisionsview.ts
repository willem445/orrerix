// The NEEDS-YOU panel (#1091 slice C, reworked by #1151 slice C): one surface,
// one list, for everything in a group that is waiting on the human.
//
//   QUESTIONS — pending `ask_human` rows. The human picks an option, types a
//   reply, or both, and the composed answer settles the row through
//   `orch_question_answer` and arrives in the orchestrator's pane as an
//   ordinary inbound notice. This panel is the TRUSTED answering surface: the
//   backend hard-codes who answered, so no agent can settle a row by any path.
//
//   NEEDS-YOU ITEMS — first-class rows from `needs-you.json` (#1151 slice A):
//   a demo parked for a look, or an ask for feedback. The item owns the ask;
//   the board row it names is joined live and acted on through the SAME
//   commands the board's own buttons call, so the two surfaces cannot disagree
//   about a task's state. **Resolving an item does not move its task** — it
//   clears the attention row, and every control that offers it says so.
//
// The two are ONE list, urgency-pinned then newest-first, because "what is
// waiting on me" is one question and the old tiering forced the human to scan
// three places for it. Settled rows fall into a faded tail that
// **Clear completed** hides — a per-group watermark, not a delete: nothing
// leaves the disk (needs-you-items.md).
//
// Structure follows `TasksView` deliberately — same overlay/embed mechanics,
// same `CoalescingRefresh` gate, same edit-in-progress deferral — because it
// is another embed on the same pane and a reader who knows one should not have
// to learn a second idiom. All projections and the answer-composition rules
// live in `decisions.ts`, DOM-free and unit-tested; this file is wiring.
//
// CONSTRAINT 1 (no PTY resize for chrome) is satisfied structurally, not by
// care: this is an `EmbedKind`, and the embed engine only ever moves elements
// between an overlay host and a flex slot — see docs/design/embedded-panels.md.
// CONSTRAINT 5 holds too: every backend touch is a typed wrapper in
// `orchestration.ts` or an `invoke` from `transport.ts`, never `@tauri-apps`.

  /** Demo feedback, routed to the verb this row's status actually admits.
   *
   *  At the merge gate (`human-testing`) this is the board's own
   *  request-changes gesture on the same two commands — record the findings,
   *  then reopen the task as working so no surface keeps offering a gate
   *  action on a row that just had changes asked of it.
   *
   *  On a `prototype` it is a plain board note instead, because
   *  `orch_request_changes` REFUSES that status (`ensure_at_merge_gate`) and
   *  sending it there would reject every time. The note reaches the
   *  orchestrator all the same — but as the generic board-edit ping, NOT with
   *  the findings inline the way the merge-gate verb delivers them: the
   *  orchestrator sees `note_count` move and reads the text with `get_task`,
   *  identically to every other human board note. It deliberately does not move
   *  the status either: a
   *  prototype that has had feedback is still a prototype until it is promoted
   *  or re-dispatched, and flipping it here would silently consume the #147
   *  demo gate.
   *
   *  **The dialog closes on SUCCESS, never before the write.** An earlier
   *  shape closed first, so any rejection destroyed everything the human had
   *  typed with no way back — the same shape the question-answer path already
   *  avoids by restoring its draft on failure. */
