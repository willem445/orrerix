// Pure encode/decode + validation for the persisted tab set (#63), split out so
// the round-trip and the corrupt-input fail-safe are unit-testable under
// `node --test` (CLAUDE.md: pure logic here, DOM/IPC wiring validated by hand).
//
// tabstore.ts is the SINGLE SOURCE of the tab schema. The bytes live in durable
// backend storage — an atomic, corrupt-quarantining tabs.json in AppData
// (src-tauri/src/uistate.rs), reached through the typed loadUiTabs/saveUiTabs
// wrappers in pty.ts (main.ts does the load→decode / snapshot→encode→save). The
// backend guarantees "valid JSON text or nothing"; decodeTabs below adds the
// SCHEMA-level guard, returning null for anything malformed so a hand-edited or
// partially-written blob degrades to a fresh tab instead of crashing boot.
//
// What persists: each tab's name, color, order, active index, and bound
// orchestration group id (so a restored group's session rehydrates into the
// right tab — see restoreSession). From #194 the schema ALSO carries a per-tab
// pane LAYOUT tree, a top-level restore PREFERENCE, and a schemaVersion — the
// data layer for full session restore (doc/design/session-restore.md). The
// live panes/PTYs are still never captured; a persisted leaf records only what
// is needed to re-spawn or resume a pane (kind, cwd, command/argv, shell kind,
// agent session id). Group panes are revived by the group-resume path, not from
// these leaves — see panerestore.ts for the per-pane restore policy.
//
// MIGRATION CONTRACT: old files (schemaVersion absent, no per-tab layout) decode
// exactly as before — shells-only. Every #194 field is optional and additive, and
// a malformed layout node degrades that tab's whole layout to null (the tab then
// restores as one empty pane on the WELCOME surface — main.ts's empty-tab fill;
// nothing spawns until the human picks a kind) rather than throwing. `encodeTabs`
// accepts a pre-#194 snapshot object (no restorePref/schemaVersion/layout)
// unchanged, so main.ts's `tabs.snapshot()` needs no change to keep writing a
// valid blob.

 *
 *  "files" (#214), "editor" and "git" (#217) and "workflow" (#222) are the PTY-less

 *  unaffected and SCHEMA_VERSION stays at 2.
 *
 *  "ssh" (#887 S4) is a pane whose process is a local ssh client. It DOES need one

 *  (see that field's own comment for why the argv is deliberately not what is
 *  replayed). Still additive and still shape-driven, so SCHEMA_VERSION stays at 2
 *  for the same reason the content kinds left it there: a v2 file that predates
 *  this simply never carries an "ssh" leaf, and decodes exactly as it always did.
 *  The DOWNGRADE direction is the one that costs something, and it costs more here
 *  than a per-entry drop: an older build's `decodePane` rejects the unknown kind,
 *  and `decodeLayout`'s whole-tree fail-safe then collapses THAT TAB's entire
 *  layout to one empty welcome pane (a docked ssh pane is the softer case — dropped

   *  This — with `sessionId` — is the WHOLE restore record for an ssh pane, and

   *
   *   1. The profile is the user's declaration and it is what they edit. S1 states
   *      the contract in `SshProfile.id`'s own comment — "a persisted pane records
   *      this id, not the profile's contents, so renaming or re-editing a profile
   *      keeps the panes that use it pointed at it". A pane that replayed a
   *      captured argv would silently keep connecting on last week's port.
   *   2. A captured argv could not be replayed as-is anyway. A claude remote
   *      command carries `--session-id <id>`, which CREATES that session; replaying
   *      it against a session the earlier run already created is an error, not a
   *      reconnect — and it cannot simply be rewritten from out here, because the
   *      whole remote command is ONE shell-quoted string inside that argv
   *      (sshcommand.ts), so rewriting it would mean re-parsing a quoting scheme
   *      that module exists to be the only implementation of.
   *
   *  So an "ssh" leaf persists `argv: null` (see `Pane.capture`), and reconnect
   *  runs profile + recorded session id back through the same S2/S3 builders a
   *  fresh launch uses (`sshReconnectArgv`). A profile deleted since is not
