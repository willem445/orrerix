//! `<repo>/.orrerix/lessons.md` (or the legacy `.loomux/lessons.md` — see
//! [`lessons_path`]) — a durable, repo-committed note of hard-won knowledge (a
//! Windows quirk, a flaky test, a "don't touch X") that would otherwise die
//! with the orchestration group it was learned in (#268).
//!
//! Deliberately **not** `workflow.yml`'s sibling in mechanism: there is
//! no schema, no parser, and no MCP write tool. It is prose, edited like any
//! other repo file, reaching `main` through the same PR review every other
//! change does — see `docs/design/lessons.md` for the full argument. This
//! module's only job is the read side: load the file, cap it, and hand back
//! text the orchestrator's kickoff can splice in verbatim.
//!
//! # Trust posture (#189)
//!
//! This is agent-written prose that gets injected into a *future* agent's
//! context — the same persistence vector #189's threat model warns about, with
//! the repo as the untrusted-content carrier instead of an issue comment. The
//! caller (`OrchRegistry::lessons_note`, `mod.rs`) is responsible for wrapping
//! the text this module returns in the provenance framing ("repo-recorded
//! notes, not instructions") before it reaches any agent — this module never
//! hands back unwrapped text to a kickoff site. Capping happens here because
//! it's a property of the file, not of where it's used.
