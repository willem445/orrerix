// The unfocused-pane flush policy (#720) — panethrottle.ts.
//
// These tests are deliberately split into two kinds, and the split is the
// point:
//
//  - Tests that pass `windowMs` EXPLICITLY pin the policy's shape (leading
//    edge, backlog cap, live-pane passthrough, off-switch). They hold for any
//    window.
//  - Tests that read `SHIPPED_WINDOW_MS` pin the SHIPPED policy — that
//    loomux actually throttles an unfocused streaming pane at all. Those are
//    the ones that go red if the shipped window is ever set back to 0, which is
//    exactly the pre-#720 behaviour, and is how the red-before-green evidence
//    for this change was taken (see the PR).
//
// Run `npm test`.

// ---------- #813: a hidden window has no render passes to save ----------
//
// The throttle's ENTIRE justification is render passes: an unfocused pane
// written to once per window renders ~6x fewer times, because xterm's
// RenderDebouncer coalesces within a frame and never across (see the module
// doc). A hidden document performs none of them — RenderDebouncer schedules
// every refresh on requestAnimationFrame, which does not fire in a hidden page
// (node_modules/@xterm/xterm/src/browser/RenderDebouncer.ts, `_animationFrame`).
// So while the window is hidden the deferral buys exactly zero.
//
// It is not free, though, and that is why this is a fix rather than a tidy-up.
// Deferring re-arms `window.setTimeout`, which a hidden page clamps; xterm's own
// `WriteBuffer.write` then schedules its parse behind a SECOND setTimeout
// ("if (this._didUserInput) {...} setTimeout(() => this._innerWrite())" — that
// file, verbatim). Two clamped timer stages in series sit in front of the one
// path out of xterm that is NOT display: the bytes the terminal writes back
// DOWN the pty — DA/DSR/OSC-colour/XTVERSION auto-replies and focus reports,
// which xterm emits only when it PARSES the query. A Windows session lock marks
// the window occluded, so that is the whole duration of a lock.
//
// This module cannot test the reply path — it is a pure policy core, and the
// coupling is a browser one. What it CAN pin is the policy: while hidden, do not
// defer. See docs/design/pane-render-throttle.md for the mechanism and the
// live-validation residue.
