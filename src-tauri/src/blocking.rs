//! The one delegation helper the gesture commands share — P1 of
//! `docs/design/performance.md`, applied to the modules #746 converts
//! (`pty`, `fileedit`, `filemgr`, `uistate`, `sessions`, `cliprobe`,
//! `editor`, `voice`, `gitwatch`).
//!
//! **Why this is a module and not a tenth copy.** `git.rs`, `gh.rs` and
//! `orchestration/mod.rs` each grew their own private `run_blocking` as their
//! own conversion landed (#399, #724, #762), which was the right size at three.
//! #746 converts twenty-five commands across nine more modules, and nine more
//! identical copies is how a mechanism drifts: one of them eventually
//! swallows a join failure, or logs instead of re-raising, and nothing says
//! which shape is the real one. The three existing copies stay where they are —
//! `git.rs`'s and `gh.rs`'s flatten a `Result` with a domain-specific message
//! and carry arguments (`git.rs`'s queue residue, #754) that are about those
//! modules, not about delegation — so folding them in here is a separate
//! change, not a drive-by in a perf slice.
//!
//! **And the two call sites that hand off WITHOUT this helper still do,
//! deliberately** — they call [`spawn_counted`] rather than `run_blocking`.
//! (Until #1601 they called `tauri::async_runtime::spawn_blocking` directly and
//! this paragraph called them "raw"; Phase 0.3 routed every hand-off in the
//! crate through the one counted door, which changed what they call and not
//! what they DO with the result — which is what the paragraph is about.)
//! `sessions.rs` `list_sessions` and `voice.rs` `voice_stop` (#58) each
//! converted before this module existed and each does something with the join
//! failure that this helper would change: `voice_stop` maps it into its
//! `Result` as a domain error the frontend toasts, and `list_sessions` degrades
//! it to an empty list because every caller of that one is already written to
//! assume "best-effort, resumable on failure". Those are decisions with their
//! own doc comments, not boilerplate waiting to be deduplicated. #746 converted
//! commands in both of those files and did not touch their neighbours' error
//! handling on the way past.
//!
//! **That set was FOUR under #1601 and is two (#1607).** `pty.rs`
//! `write_pty`/`change_dir` were the other two. They did not move behind
//! `run_blocking` — they left the pool altogether: epic #1600 Phase 2.3 put
//! the input path on a thread per pane (P8-writer), because this pool is a
//! bounded shared resource and beta6 exhausted it with parked orchestration
//! poll ticks until keystrokes could not be scheduled at all (#1600 §1.2).
//! Their bodies now go to `PtyManager::enqueue_frontend_write` /
//! `enqueue_cd` and await the writer thread's completion reply.
//!
//! **The counts, measured at this tree rather than carried:**
//! `async_runtime::spawn_blocking(` over `src-tauri/src` + `crates` is **1**
//! — this module's own door, which is the property
//! `tests/selfwatch.rs`'s `there_is_exactly_one_door_onto_the_blocking_pool`
//! pins. `spawn_counted(` is **6**: `run_blocking`'s own use here, the three
//! private wrappers (`gh.rs`, `git.rs`, `orchestration/mod.rs`), and the two
//! named above. Re-measure both before quoting either — a figure in a comment
//! is dated to the commit it was measured on.
//!
//! **What the command owes on top of calling this.** Delegation is only half of
//! INV-1: `spawn_blocking` moves the body, and Tauri still polls the future on
//! the webview thread up to the first `.await`, so anything a command does
//! before this call is still main-thread work (#724). Hand the WHOLE body over.
//!
//! And the half no helper can carry — **the reentrancy argument**. Synchronous
//! dispatch was an accidental mutual exclusion: one thread ran every command
//! body, so no two could ever interleave and nothing had to say why that was
//! safe. Moving a command off it is therefore a concurrency change, not just a
//! latency one. Every converted command in #746 carries a `**Reentrancy.**`
//! paragraph naming what serialized it before and what protects it now — a
//! lock, an atomic ticket, an idempotent write — or the interleaving it accepts
//! and why. Four of them needed a guard building rather than naming
//! (`uistate`'s write ordering, `fileedit`'s write mutex, `sessions`'s
//! launch-intent lock, `gitwatch`'s dispatch ticket); the rest already had one
//! and it simply became load-bearing.

/// **The one door onto the blocking pool** (#1601 Phase 0.3), and the only
/// `tauri::async_runtime::spawn_blocking` call left in `src-tauri/src`.
///
/// Returns exactly what awaiting a `spawn_blocking` handle returns, so it is a
/// substitution and not a policy: `run_blocking` below still re-raises a
/// panicked body, `gh.rs` and `git.rs` still flatten it into their own domain
/// error, and the two sites that skip `run_blocking` (`sessions.rs`
/// `list_sessions`, `voice.rs` `voice_stop`) still each do the thing this
/// module's header says they deliberately do. What changes is that neither of
/// them reaches the runtime directly any more.
///
/// That set was four when #1601 wrote this line: it also named `pty.rs`
/// `write_pty`/`change_dir`. #1607 took those two off the pool entirely rather
/// than moving them behind this door — see the module header — so they are no
/// longer sites that skip `run_blocking`, they are sites that hand off to a
/// thread per pane and never enter the pool at all.
///
/// **Why one door rather than a counter at each site.** The count only means
/// anything if it is complete — a report reading `in-flight 480` is a
/// diagnosis, and one reading `in-flight 480 plus however many sites nobody
/// wrapped` is not. Eight hand-wrapped sites is a convention, checked by
/// whoever remembers; one door is a property a source scan can pin, and
/// `src-tauri/tests/selfwatch.rs` pins it. (That "eight" is #1601's count of
/// the alternative it rejected, dated to `bfbab80f` and left as written — it
/// is a statement about a counterfactual, not about this tree. The tree's own
/// figures are in the module header, measured.)
///
/// **Where the ticket is taken is the whole point.** It is taken HERE, before
/// the hand-off, and moved into the task — so the depth counts work that is
/// still QUEUED as well as work that is running. A counter incremented inside
/// the closure would read 512 at saturation and go no higher, hiding the queue
/// behind it, which is the number the plan's §1.2 mechanism actually turns on.
