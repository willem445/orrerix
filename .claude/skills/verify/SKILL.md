# Verifying a change in orrerix

Orrerix is a GUI app (Tauri window) whose core behavior involves live PTYs and
real agent CLIs — the two things you must NOT drive yourself. Verification here
means: exercise everything that is automatable, then hand the human a precise
manual checklist for the rest.

## Always run (both halves — a change to one often breaks the other's assumptions)

Agent workers: local `cargo` of any kind is banned — see
`.claude/skills/ci-validate`. Run the node-only half locally; everything Rust
goes to CI, which is the sole authority for the CI gate regardless of what ran
anywhere else.

```sh
npm run build                 # tsc --noEmit typecheck + Vite bundle
npm test                      # frontend unit tests (Node 22 built-in runner)
```

The Rust half — CI runs it on every push; **for a human running this skill by
hand**, it is:

```sh
cargo check --locked --workspace   # what CI gates on — from the repo root
cargo test --locked --workspace    # backend unit + integration tests
```

## Exercise the change itself, not just the suites

- **Pure frontend logic** (layout math, steering compose, spawn expiry,
  clipboard formatting…): the logic lives in a DOM-free module — write or
  extend a `test/*.test.ts` that drives the new behavior with realistic
  inputs, and also run a quick one-off `node --test` on that file.
- **Backend orchestration logic**: drive it through
  `src-tauri/tests/orchestration/` — it dispatches real MCP JSON through
  `dispatch()` against a real `OrchRegistry` in a temp dir. Faking an agent =
  creating a registry entry + calling tools with its `Caller`; never spawn a
  real CLI.
- **New backend commands**: confirm the `#[tauri::command]` is registered in
  `lib.rs` and has a typed wrapper in `src/pty.ts` (or the feature's own bridge)
  that calls `src/transport.ts` — a missing registration compiles fine and fails
  only at runtime.

## Never do

- **Never spawn a real agent CLI** (`claude`, `copilot`, `gemini` — not even
  `--resume` or with a trivial prompt): it burns the user's paid credits. The
  user does live validation.
- **Don't run `npm run tauri dev` unattended** — it opens a window and blocks
  forever. Only useful when the human is present to click through.
- **Don't add a unit test that links the full lib** — on Windows it will fail
  to load (missing comctl32-v6 manifest). Put it in `src-tauri/tests/`
  (see CLAUDE.md constraint 4).

## Hand off a manual checklist

End with a short, concrete list of what the human should verify live, e.g.:

- which pane/overlay to open and what to look for,
- which orchestration flow to run (spawn a worker, send a report, …),
- any Windows-specific behavior (ConPTY repaint, clipboard, Job Object kill).

Be specific ("split right twice, open git view, drag the graph/diff divider")
— "test the UI" is not a checklist. If the change touches scrollback, panes,
or PTY sizing, explicitly ask the human to watch for repaint artifacts.
