// Unit tests for the embed focus-request hook's pure core (#1091 slice C).
//
// The property under test is the one the hook exists for and the one a
// hand-check would never catch: a request parked for a view that has not been
// CONSTRUCTED yet must still be there when it first renders, and must be gone
// on the render after that. Everything else about the hook is DOM (paneembeds.ts
// opens the view and the view scrolls a row into sight), validated by hand per
// this repo's convention. Run with `npm test`.
