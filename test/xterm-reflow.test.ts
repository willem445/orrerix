// Regression pin for #430: loomux sideloads conpty 1.22 (VT passthrough +
// PSEUDOCONSOLE_RESIZE_QUIRK), which never repaints on resize and trusts the
// terminal to reflow itself. xterm.js's own reflow (Buffer.ts's
// _reflowLarger/_reflowSmaller) has always refused to touch the row the
// cursor sits on -- intentionally, on the assumption the shell repaints its
// own prompt line -- which is exactly the assumption conpty's resize-quirk
// mode breaks. PSReadLine then repaints its input line at cursor coordinates
// conpty reports assuming a fully-reflowed buffer, landing inside stale,
// already-rendered output.
//
// The investigation that scoped this PR (see #430's investigation comment)
// cited xterm.js#5321 ("Reflow on resize using similar logic to conpty",
// released in @xterm/xterm 6.0.0) as an upstream fix already released. That
// turned out not to hold up: #5321 was reverted wholesale by xterm.js#5358
// after it bricked buffers in VS Code, which reopened xterm.js#5319 --
// loomux's exact signature bug. #5319 is closed again, but as "track this in
// microsoft/vscode#224488 for now" (maintainer comment), not as fixed; that
// VS Code issue is itself closed with the same conpty.dll sideload disabled
// in Insiders over open resize-duplication reports against the very conpty
// build loomux ships (1.22.250204002). Bumping @xterm/xterm alone does NOT
// fix #430 -- pinned below (still red on a stock v6 bump).
//
// The lever that measurably helps is xterm.js#5234's `reflowCursorLine`
// option (added in 6.0.0, off by default "because shells usually handle this
// themselves" -- which conpty's resize-quirk explicitly does not). pane.ts
// sets it alongside windowsPty, gated to the conpty branch.
//
// PRECISE characterization (measured, not assumed -- see #430 follow-up
// issue for the tracker this feeds): reflowCursorLine fixes the cursor's
// ROW in BOTH resize directions, and fixes the COLUMN in NEITHER direction,
// by design: xterm.js#5522 (merged, milestone 7.0.0, not yet released)
// documents "this will not move the cursor position, only the line
// contents" against xterm.js#5295 ("Cursor is incorrectly positioned on
// reflow of cursor line"). So the row lands right; the column does not, on
// every resize, regardless of direction. Whether a subsequent write visibly
// SPLITS across a row boundary is incidental -- it depends on how far the
// (always wrong) column sits from the new row's width, not on a real
// widen-vs-narrow asymmetry in the underlying defect.
//
// There is a real, if partial, upside worth pinning too: WITHOUT
// reflowCursorLine, a narrowing resize doesn't reflow the cursor's line at
// all, and content beyond the old (wider) row boundary becomes unreachable
// -- verified below as content loss (72 of 120 characters survive). WITH
// the option, the same resize preserves all of it (see the content-
// preservation test), even though the cursor still ends up in the wrong
// column.
//
// The VT stream below is hand-constructed from the upstream repro shape
// (wrapped output, a live width change) per xterm.js#5319 / microsoft/
// terminal#18725's minimal repro description -- not a captured real PTY
// trace (no safe repro was constructed for a live capture; see the PR
// description).
