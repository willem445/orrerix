// Pure, DOM-free core of the per-pty event routers (#1301). The Tauri wiring
// lives in pty.ts (`ensureOutputRouter`/`attachOutput`/`detachOutput` and the
// git-watch pair); everything that DECIDES what is kept, dropped or released
// is here so it is unit-testable under `node --test` — the same split as
// panethrottle.ts, which owns the *rate* half of the same subsystem.
//
// What this is for
// ----------------
// One backend event stream (`pty-output`, `git-changed`) carries every pane's
// traffic, demultiplexed frontend-side by pty id. That means a MODULE-LEVEL
// map from pty id to a handler closure, and a handler closure for a pane
// captures the pane — its `Terminal`, its xterm buffer (`scrollback` lines ×
// cols × 12 B, so tens of MB for a pane an agent has been printing into for
// hours), its DOM subtree and every view hanging off it. An entry nobody
// removes is therefore not a leaked number. It is a leaked pane, and a
// many-hour orchestration session that spawns and kills ~40 of them leaks
// them by the hundred-MB (#1301).
//
// Two things went wrong under the old flat `Map<number, Handler>`, and this
// module exists to make both structurally impossible rather than remembered:
//
//   1. ATTACHING TWICE. A pane that respawns in place (`Pane.respawnFresh` —
//      #194 BUG-1's dead-`--resume` backstop, #887 S4's ssh reconnect, and
//      #407's promotion) gets a NEW pty id and attaches under it, while its
//      OLD id's entry stays. The pane is then permanently reachable from the
//      router even after `Pane.dispose()`, because dispose only knows the
//      CURRENT id. Fixed by keying on the OWNER as well: one live attachment
//      per owner, so attaching an owner to a new id releases whatever it held
//      before. Nothing has to remember to detach first, which is the only
//      kind of fix that survives the next call site.
//
//   2. HOLDING FOREVER. Output that arrives for an id with no handler is held
//      so a pane can never lose its process's first bytes to a listen/spawn
//      race. That buffer had no bound and no expiry, and — because `release`
//      only deleted the queue rather than retiring the id — a byte arriving
//      one tick after a pane was torn down opened a fresh one that nothing
//      would ever collect. Bytes for an id that will never attach (a pane
//      whose creation timed out, which is #1301's own presenting symptom, or
//      one disposed while its kill was still in flight) accumulated for the
//      life of the process.
//
// Why an id can be retired for good: pty ids are minted by
// `AtomicU32::fetch_add` (`src-tauri/src/pty.rs`, `spawn_pty`), so they are
// monotonic and never reused within a run. An id this router has released has
// no second life, and dropping its late bytes cannot cost a future pane
// anything.
//
// Only the OUTPUT router holds anything. A `git-changed` event is a signal,
// not a payload — a missed one costs a refresh, never data — so the git-watch
// router uses `attach`/`handler`/`release` and never calls `hold`.

/** A pane's identity as far as the routers are concerned: the `Pane` object
 *  itself at the call site, anything with reference identity in a test.
 *  Deliberately not a pty id — the whole point of rule 1 above is that the

 *  to be unbounded.
 *

 *  not weaken it. `MAX_PREATTACH_IDS` does, and says so — see its own doc.
 *
 *  Overflow sheds from the FRONT, keeping the tail: a terminal's screen is

 *
 *  The third cap INV-8(a) asks for, and it is not redundant with the byte cap:
 *  the byte cap bounds the PAYLOAD, while each held chunk also costs a
 *  `{chunk, bytes}` wrapper plus a `Uint8Array` header whose size has nothing
 *  to do with how many bytes it carries. Measured on this repo's Node
 *  (`node --expose-gc`, 200k entries of `{chunk: new Uint8Array(1), bytes: 1}`,
 *  heapUsed delta across forced GCs, three runs): **274 B per entry**. So a
 *  drip of 1-byte writes fills 256 KiB only after ~262k chunks and sheds
 *  nothing on the way, for ~72 MB of wrapper heap against a cap that says
 *  256 KiB.
 *
 *  Reaching that needs a pty nobody attaches writing single bytes for over an
 *  hour: the backend coalesces at `PTY_EMIT_MIN_INTERVAL_MS` = 16 ms
 *  (`src-tauri/src/ptyout.rs`), so ~62.5 chunks/s, so ~70 minutes. Extreme —
 *  which is why it is a cap and not a crisis — but the invariant this PR
 *  authors says "bytes AND entries, each with the number stated", and a bound
 *  that a real input shape can walk around is not a bound.
 *
 *  512 rather than a rounder number, for a stated property: 512 × 274 B ≈
 *  137 KiB of wrapper stays UNDER the 256 KiB payload cap, so the unit the
 *  class is named for remains the dominant term. It is also ~8 s of maximally
 *  coalesced drip, three orders above the one-`await` bridge this buffer
 *  actually exists for. Per-id worst case ≈ 256 KiB + 137 KiB ≈ 393 KiB. */

 *  to still be waiting for an attach.
 *
 *  THIS is the cap that makes lossless startup conditional, and the condition
 *  is worth stating plainly rather than leaving as an argument: eviction drops
 *  an id's ENTIRE held buffer, so a pane that later does attach past 64

 *  beside the guarantee itself, because a guarantee whose exception lives only
 *  in the module that takes it is a guarantee nobody reads correctly.
