// The visibility policy for event-driven embed views (#1318) — `src/wakegate.ts`.
//
// The defect this pins: `TasksView`/`DecisionsView` refetched and rebuilt on every
// `orch-tasks-changed` / `orch-questions-changed` / `orch-needs-you-changed` event in
// every pane that had ever opened one, on screen or not. What the gate below actually
// closes is the CLOSED-PANEL half of that — see `VisibleProbe`'s doc for the two states
// it is blind to, and #1465, which owns them. The policy is one predicate, so it is
// tested as one — the DOM wiring (`EmbedEntry.hide`, the views' `show()`/`hide()`) is
// validated by hand through `__wakeGateStats()`, per the module header.
//
// WHY THE FOUR CROSSINGS. The gate reads TWO inputs — the `wake()`/`sleep()` latch and
// the pane's live `confirm` probe — and the repo's standing rule is that a guard reading
// two inputs pins all four crossings plus a negative control, so "suppress everything"
// and "run everything" both fail. The negative control here is `a visible view refreshes
// on every wake`: without it, a gate hard-wired to `return false` would pass every
// suppression assertion in the file.
