//! The NEEDS-YOU item registry (#1151 slice A) — the durable record behind the
//! panel's demo and feedback rows.
//!
//! # Why an entity at all, when the board already had the statuses
//!
//! Before this, the panel's DEMOS tier was a **pure projection** of `tasks.json`
//! rows whose status was demo-gated: the panel entry *was* the task. That gives
//! the thing a human is being asked to look at no identity of its own — no "who
//! raised this and when", no close-out that is not also a board move, and no way
//! for an agent to ask for a look at something that is not a board row at all.
//! Resolving such a row could only mean moving the task, which is a different
//! decision from "I have seen this".
//!
//! So a needs-you item is a first-class record: it **owns who asked, when, why,
//! and open/resolved**, and it *links* a task rather than copying one.
//! `demo_path`, `pr`, `assignee` and the proceed/feedback affordances are joined
//! live from `tasks.json` at render — snapshotting them onto the item would be
//! the drift machine the panel's own header already warns about. The item is the
//! lifecycle record; the task keeps owning the facts.
//!
//! # Why this is not `humanq`, and not `AttentionItem`
//!
//! *A note on how [`super::humanq`]'s answer-source type is referred to below.*
//! It is named indirectly, never spelled, throughout this file — on purpose.
//! `the_mcp_surface_has_no_path_to_the_answer_entry_point` asserts that exactly
//! two source files under `src/` contain that identifier at all, so that a new
//! file naming it is a new answering surface and has to be argued for. Spelling
//! it here in prose would cost that guard an allowlist row it cannot verify —
//! "prose only" is not something a text scan can check, and the row would still
//! be sitting there on the day the prose became code. A doc link is not worth
//! weakening a security guard, so this file describes the type instead.
//!
//! **Not `humanq`.** `questions.json` is a shipped public contract with a
//! purpose-built trust boundary (a closed answer-source enum, two boundary tests),
//! and *answering* a question — which releases the work that was waiting on it —
//! is a different power from *resolving* an item, which acknowledges that a
//! human has looked. Folding the two stores together would widen the one surface
//! #946 spent three layers keeping narrow. The panel unions two registries; the
//! registries stay apart.
//!
//! **Not "attention".** `AttentionItem` is already taken by the pane-chip scan
//! (`mod.rs`, with a frontend mirror in `src/attention.ts`) — unrelated
//! machinery. This module keeps its own vocabulary behind the `needsyou::` path
//! (`needsyou::Item`, `needsyou::Kind`), following the precedent [`super::humanq`]
//! set for exactly this reason: pick a distinct word rather than overload one.
//!
//! # The resolve boundary
//!
//! An item is settled four ways, and they are deliberately not one operation:
//!
//! 1. **The human resolves it** — [`ResolveSource`] is a closed enum supplied by
//!    the entry point (`orch_needs_you_resolve` hard-codes
//!    [`ResolveSource::Webview`]), never a caller-supplied string, so "resolve as
//!    the human" has no spelling. Same shape and same reason as
//!    [`super::humanq`]'s own answer-source enum.
//! 2. **The human dismisses it** (#2137) — the same surface and the same closed
//!    enum ([`ResolveSource::WebviewDismiss`], via `orch_needs_you_dismiss`),
//!    saying something different: *this no longer matters*, as opposed to *I
//!    have looked*. Settles as `dismissed:webview`.
//! 3. **The raiser withdraws it** — an item overtaken by events should not need
//!    a human click. Settles as `withdrawn:<agent>`, which is visibly not a
//!    human's acknowledgement.
//! 4. **The board resolves it** — a task leaving the demo-gated statuses
//!    auto-resolves its demo item as `board:<new-status>`. The board moved, so
//!    the ask is moot.
//!
//! Taking your own ask back, the board moving on, and the human declining to
//! look at all are each weaker than a human saying "seen" — `resolved_by` is
//! what keeps them distinguishable forever, which is why every settle records
//! one and none of them deletes a row.
//!
//! # Clearing is not deleting
//!
//! "Clear completed" is a per-group **watermark** (the `needs-you-cleared`
//! marker file, the `set_notify` marker precedent), not a row mutation and not a
//! delete: the panel hides settled rows stamped at or before it, and the rows on
//! disk are untouched. That is literally "clears the UI, persists on disk", it
//! survives a restart, and it can never touch an OPEN row.
