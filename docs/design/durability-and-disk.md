# Design: durable writes + disk hygiene

Status: implemented (issues #133, #134, #240); the #134 shared build cache
described below was **removed** by #263 — see that section for why.

## Problem

On 2026-07-07 a live orchestration ran the machine's `C:` drive to **0 bytes
free**. Two independent failures fell out of that one condition:

1. **The task board was destroyed.** An `upsert_task` persisted the board with
   `fs::write(tasks.json, …)`, which *truncates then writes*. The write failed
   partway with os error 112 ("not enough space on the disk"), so the previous
   good contents were already gone: `list_tasks` came back `[]` and every
   existing task id read as `unknown task`. All 13 live tasks and their note
   threads were lost. A failed write was **destructive** instead of a no-op.
2. **The disk filled in the first place** because every agent git-worktree that
   runs `cargo check`/`cargo test` grows its own cargo `target/` cache at
   5–7 GB each. A day of orchestrated work left ~10 worktrees ≈ 50 GB of
   duplicate build caches, with nothing bounding or reclaiming them.

This note covers the fix for both: make durable writes atomic (#133), plus a
backstop that warns before the disk hits zero (#134). (A shared build cache
once addressed the per-worktree cost too, but it corrupted concurrent builds
and special-cased cargo, so it was removed — #263.)

## Part 1 — atomic durable writes (#133)

### The pattern

`atomic_write(path, bytes)` in `crates/loomux-engine/src/fsatomic.rs` (#888
slice A3 batch 9; re-exported as `orchestration::atomic_write`, which is what
every call site still spells) replaces a file durably:

1. Write the new contents to a **same-directory** temp sibling
   (`.<name>.<pid>.<seq>.tmp`).
2. `sync_all()` the temp so its data blocks reach disk before it is linked into
   place — this is the exact guard against the disk-full failure mode, where a
   rename could otherwise expose a metadata-only file whose bytes never landed.
3. `fs::rename` the temp over the destination. On Windows this maps to
   `MoveFileExW` with `REPLACE_EXISTING`, which atomically replaces the target
   on the **same volume** (hence the same-directory temp — a cross-volume move
   is a non-atomic copy). A crash or failure at any point leaves the previous
   good file intact; at worst an orphaned `.tmp` sibling is left behind, never a
   truncated destination.

If the rename fails (the destination is momentarily locked — antivirus, an open
reader), it falls back to a direct write so the update isn't silently lost, and
keeps the temp on failure for manual recovery.

### getrandom constraint

The temp name must be unique per write, but the Windows-10 baseline can't load
the `ProcessPrng` that `tempfile`/`uuid`/`rand` pull in (see the Cargo.toml
note). So the name is deterministic: `pid` + a process-monotonic `AtomicU64`
counter. Uniqueness is what matters (two concurrent writers to one file must not
share a scratch path), not unpredictability — and an atomic counter delivers
that without a getrandom crate.

### Audit of every durable write in the group dir

| File | Writer | Lock while writing | Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tasks.json` | `write_tasks` | `tasks_lock` (all callers) | → `atomic_write` |
| `state.json` | `set_state` | **none** (see below) | → `atomic_write` |
| `agents.json` | `persist_agent_record` | `tasks_lock` | → `atomic_write` |
| `group.json` | `create_group` | creation-time, single writer | → `atomic_write` |
| `group.json` | `persist_max_agents` | — | already atomic; refactored onto the shared helper |
| `usage.json` | `upsert_usage_snapshot` | `tasks_lock` | already atomic; refactored onto the shared helper |
| `queue.json` | `persist_queues` (#468) | `queue_persist`, held across read-then-write | `atomic_write`. **Snapshot, not journal** — see below |
| `queue-orphans-archive.jsonl` (#547) | `archive_staged_overflow` (append), `readmit_archived` (rewrite) | `queue_persist`, held across both | **append-only** for the roll (`append_durable` — one `write_all`, then `sync_all`); `atomic_write` for the rewrite that removes a re-admitted entry. See below |
| `audit.jsonl` | `append_audit` | `AUDIT_LOCK` (#240) | **append-only** — a failed append can't truncate prior lines, so `atomic_write` is the wrong tool. Its own atomicity problem, and its own fix: see Part 1b |
| `configs/<id>.json`, role `*.md`, attachments | derived/one-shot | — | not mutable durable state — regenerated or uniquely named, so a failed write is retryable, not destructive; left as plain `fs::write` |
| `agent-seq.json` (#524) | `mint_agent_seq` | `agent_seq_persist`, held across seed-then-mint-then-write | `atomic_write`. **At the orchestration ROOT, not in a group dir** — see below |

`state.json` is written by `set_state` **without a lock**. Two concurrent
`set_state` calls are still safe under `atomic_write`: each writes its own
uniquely-named temp and renames last-writer-wins, so the reader never sees a
torn file — the worst case is one update superseding another, never corruption.
(In practice a group has one orchestrator, so concurrent `set_state` is rare.)

`tabs.json` / `uistate.rs` (project tabs, PR #157) was **not** merged when this
landed; that store already writes atomically (temp + rename) and needs nothing.

**One precision about `atomic_write`'s contract, since this document is where
people come to rely on it** (#523 review): the temp + fsync + rename path is
crash-safe as described, but the *fallback* taken when the rename fails (the
destination is briefly locked — antivirus, an open reader) is a plain in-place
`fs::write`, which truncates before it writes. A crash inside that narrow
fallback window can therefore still leave a truncated destination. It is the
rare branch of a rare branch, and every reader of these files degrades
gracefully on an unparseable one (`queue.json` falls back to the audit
derivation; `tasks.json`/`state.json` to an empty value), but "never a
truncated file" is an overstatement of what the helper guarantees — it is
"never a truncated file on the rename path", which is the path essentially
every write takes.

`queue.json` (#468, added later) is the delivery queue's durable copy, and it is
the one file in this table where the append-vs-replace choice was genuinely
open: it records pending work, and the obvious shape for "what is pending" is a
journal of queue events like `audit.jsonl`'s. It is a **whole-file snapshot**
instead. A journal would need replay logic to reconstruct current state,
compaction to stay bounded, and would leave a half-replayed queue reachable if a
record were lost; a pane's queue is capped at 8 entries, so the whole file is a
few KB and `atomic_write` costs nothing to rewrite per mutation. Its writer lock
is held across *read-then-write* (not just the write) so a stale snapshot can
never land after a fresh one — the ordering hazard `state.json`'s
last-writer-wins note above tolerates, which a queue cannot. Lock order is
`queue_persist` → `queues`, and the write happens with no queue lock held: file
I/O inside that critical section would stall every delivery in the registry. See
`docs/design/orchestration.md`'s "Durability (#468/#467)".

`queue-orphans-archive.jsonl` (#547) is the one file here that is **both**
shapes, and each half is chosen for the failure it must not have. It holds
staged orphans that have rolled off `queue.json` so the per-admission fsync
stops growing with the age of the install (the argument, the policy and the
crash-ordering are in `docs/design/orchestration.md`'s "Bounding the snapshot
write"). The roll is an **append** — `append_durable`, one `write_all` then
`sync_all` — because these records are the only remaining copy of payloads
just removed from the snapshot, so the file must be at least as durable as
what it took them out of, and an append cannot truncate the records already
in it. Removing a record (a re-admitted entry) is the one operation an append
cannot express, and it is a whole-file **replace** through `atomic_write` for
`tasks.json`'s reason: a truncating in-place rewrite of this file would be a
disk-full path that eats every other orphan in it. Both halves are taken under
`queue_persist`, the same lock `queue.json` is written under, because the two
files are one store: an entry is being moved between them and the pair must
never be observed with it in neither. The ordering that guarantees that —
append before remove, in both directions — is why the worst crash outcome here
is a duplicate record, which `queue::parse_archive` dedupes on delivery id.

**The replace half carries every line it did not set out to remove, verbatim**
(#547 review B1). It is built from the file's raw lines (`queue::scan_archive`),
not from parsed records: parsing is used only to test whether a line is the
record being removed, so a record written by a build with a newer per-line `v`
— or a line torn by the very disk-full failure this document is about — is
written back byte for byte instead of being dropped for being unreadable. This
is the property that makes the pair safe to describe as one store. A
whole-file replace rebuilt from what the writer could parse is a *lossy*
replace, and a lossy replace of the file holding the only copy of a payload is
the #133 failure with extra steps: it does not truncate the file, it truncates
the set.

`agent-seq.json` (#524) is the one entry in this table that is **not** in a
group dir, and that placement is the design decision rather than an oversight.
The counter it protects is registry-global — one `seq` mints `w-3` in one group
and `rev-4` in the next — so a per-group copy would need a max-across-every-group
read before the first mint and would still lose the mark whenever a group dir is
swept, while the artifacts keyed by the ids it handed out (a board `assignee`, an
audit row, an `agent/<id>` branch in the human's repo) do not go with it. A plain
file at the root is invisible to both root scans: `session_roles` skips any entry
without a `group.json`, and `existing_group_ids` filters on `is_dir()`.

Its lock is held across seed → mint → write for the same reason `queue_persist`
is held across read-then-write: persisting outside the critical section lets two
concurrent mints write out of order and leave the file *below* an id already
handed out, which is precisely the reuse the file exists to prevent. The write
also lands **before** the id is returned to the caller, so a crash mid-spawn
cannot leave an artifact without its mark.

**This is the one file in the table whose failed write is recoverable from
somewhere else, and that is deliberate.** A failed write is audited
(`agent-seq-persist-failed`) and not propagated — `persist_queues`' rule, for
`persist_queues`' reason — which means the id is handed out anyway and the file
is left *behind* what has actually been issued. Since `atomic_write`'s failure
mode is disk-full and this project has three recorded disk-exhaustion incidents
(above), that is a correlated risk rather than a tail one. So the reader
compensates: the seed takes `max(agent-seq.json, highest id in every group's
agents.json)` rather than believing the file whenever it parses, and a mint whose
write failed is still covered by the roster row its spawn goes on to write. See
`docs/design/orchestration.md`'s "Agent ids that survive a restart" for the
invariant that buys and the narrow window it does not.

## Part 1b — atomic appends (#240)

The #133 audit above was right that an append can't truncate what came before,
and wrong to stop there. **Replaces and appends fail differently, so they need
different fixes**, and the append path had no fix at all:

- A **replace** is destructive on failure — a partial `fs::write` leaves a
  truncated file. Cure: temp + fsync + rename (`atomic_write`).
- An **append** is destructive on *concurrency* — `O_APPEND` (and Windows'
  `FILE_APPEND_DATA`) atomically positions each write at the current end of
  file, but that guarantee is **per write syscall**, not per logical record. A
  record emitted as many small writes is a record another writer can be
  scheduled into the middle of. Cure: one write syscall per record, plus a lock
  so appends and rotation don't race.

`append_audit` was emitting `writeln!(f, "{line}")` where `line` is a
`serde_json::Value`: `Display` walks the JSON tree and writes it out token by
token. Concurrent auditors — a mass `agent-exit` at group shutdown, background
delivery threads — therefore spliced each other **character by character**. A
real group's log (`sempkg-74fe4043`) held 20 lines like
`{{""actionaction""::""agent-exitagent-exit""`. The corruption was invisible
because `parse_audit_lines` skipped unparseable lines in silence; a torn log
just read as a slightly shorter timeline.

The fix has three parts:

1. **One buffer, one `write_all`.** The record and its `\n` are serialized up
   front and handed to the OS in a single call. This alone is what makes a record
   atomic against *any* appender, in this process or another.

   Stated precisely, because the whole argument rests on it: `write_all` *loops*
   on a short write, and each iteration would be its own append — so this is one
   write syscall **in practice**, not by contract. Regular-file writes of a
   record-sized buffer on our baselines (Windows, Linux) are issued as one write
   and return complete or fail; short writes are pipe/socket/`ENOSPC` behavior.
   Worth restating rather than claiming a guarantee the API doesn't make — audit
   records can be large, since full prompt texts land here.
2. **`AUDIT_LOCK`** — a process-wide `std::sync::Mutex<()>` (no new deps, no
   getrandom) held across `rotate_audit_if_needed` + the append, as one unit. It
   buys two things a single write can't: no thread holds an append handle across
   another thread's rotation rename, and two threads can't both act on a
   past-the-cap size check and *both* rename — the second would move the fresh,
   nearly-empty log over `audit.1.jsonl` and discard the 8 MB generation the
   first just retained. The lock is cheap by construction: an audit record is a
   few hundred bytes written every few seconds, and the lock is held only for
   the open+write, never across orchestration work. `lock_safe` (obs::LockExt)
   keeps a poisoned lock from turning best-effort auditing into a panic cascade.

   The two halves of the fix protect *different* failures, and each is verified
   by a test that goes red without it. This matters: the single `write_all` alone
   makes the corruption tests pass, so without a dedicated reproducer the lock
   would ship on argument only. The check-to-rename window is a few instructions
   wide, so `set_rotate_check_pause_for_test` (a thread-local, zero in production,
   read only when a rollover actually fires) widens it on demand and lets
   `concurrent_rotations_keep_the_retained_generation` force the double-rename.
   With the lock removed but `write_all` kept, that test loses **all 50** seeded
   records, 6 runs out of 6.
3. **The shims stay single-`printf`.** `gh_shim_sh` / `git_shim_sh` append from
   *other processes*, where no mutex of ours reaches. They're correct for the
   same reason as rule 1 — one `printf` of one whole line through `>>` is one
   `write(2)` — and that's now stated at both call sites. Building a shim's
   audit line across two redirections would reintroduce this bug across
   processes.

**The rotation/append handle race is accepted, not fixed.** A shim can open the
log a moment before a rename and write through that handle afterwards; the
handle keeps pointing at the same file, so the line lands at the tail of
`audit.1.jsonl` instead of the fresh `audit.jsonl`. It is never lost — the
viewer (`audit_log`) and the roster backfill both read the rotated generation
first — only its position in the timeline shifts, and only for a record that
raced an 8 MB rollover. Closing that would need cross-process locking for no
real gain.

**Silence was half the bug.** `parse_audit_lines_counted` now reports how many
non-blank lines failed to parse, and `audit_log` breadcrumbs a non-zero count
(`audit-lines-unreadable group=… skipped=…`) — once per *change*, because the
viewer re-polls in follow mode and every log written before this fix keeps its
torn lines forever. Unreadable lines are still skipped
— a torn log must not blank the viewer — but they are no longer skipped
*quietly*. `obs::breadcrumb_in` had the identical multi-write defect (its doc
already claimed "one `O_APPEND` write, atomic per line"); it now builds the line
and writes it once.

## Part 2 — disk hygiene (#134, shared cache removed by #263)

### Shared worktree build cache — removed (#263)

`#134` added a mechanism that pointed `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` at
`<main-repo-root>/.loomux-target` for any pane whose cwd was a **linked git
worktree**, so worktrees would share one build cache instead of each growing
its own 5–7 GB `target/`. The injection lived in `pty.rs::apply_pane_env`, with
worktree-ness detected purely from the filesystem (a linked worktree's `.git`
is a *file* whose `commondir` resolves to the main repo's `.git`) and
`LOOMUX_NO_SHARED_TARGET` as a one-env-var rollback.

**Removed entirely in #263**, for two independent reasons:

1. **Concurrency corruption, not just contention.** The design doc originally
   accepted that concurrent `cargo` invocations against one target dir would
   *serialize* on cargo's target-dir lock. Live use proved a worse failure
   mode: concurrent `cargo check` runs from stacked worktrees **collided on
   shared build-script outputs** in `.loomux-target` (os error 32 file lock on
   `OpenConsole.exe`, exit 101) — the shared dir doesn't just make concurrent
   builds wait, it makes them corrupt each other.
2. **Toolchain-specific product code.** `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` is a name only
   cargo recognizes; the whole mechanism silently no-ops for every non-Rust
   repo. loomux's convention is to stay toolchain-agnostic rather than special-
   case one toolchain in product code — see the paused #263 investigation
   comment on the issue for the fuller alternatives analysis (a generic
   cache-budget engine, measure-and-warn, orphaned-scratch-dir cleanup) that a
   future design review can pick back up if disk pressure returns.

Per-worktree `target/` dirs (the pre-#134, and now current, default) are the
correct behavior going forward. Disk usage is the operator's trade to manage —
via a repo- or machine-level cleanup cron, an operator-set `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`
pointed at a self-managed location (still respected, never overridden by
loomux), or simply accepting the per-worktree cost. The 42–52 GB
`.loomux-target` directory from the #263 incident is orphaned by this removal
and safe to delete by hand; loomux does not delete it automatically.

### Low-disk backstop

`start_disk_monitor` samples free space on the workspace drive (the app-data
root, where the board/state live — the surface a disk-full write corrupts) every
`DISK_CHECK_INTERVAL` (60 s; slow on purpose — pressure builds over minutes, so
the `sysinfo` scan stays negligible). When free space crosses below
`LOW_DISK_BYTES` (5 GB — headroom for one more cold cargo build to be reclaimed
before writes fail at 0), it delivers **one** audited notice to each group's
orchestrator suggesting reclamation (end merged worktrees, `cargo clean` idle
ones, clear temp).

The latch discipline mirrors the watchdog/idle-tick notices:

- **One per episode** — a machine-wide latch, set on the crossing tick and
  cleared only once free space recovers past `LOW_DISK_CLEAR_BYTES`
  (`LOW_DISK_BYTES` + 2 GB). The hysteresis stops a disk hovering at the
  threshold from re-notifying every tick.
- **Paused groups are skipped** — their agents idle out on purpose and delivery
  is suppressed there anyway.

The latch/hysteresis (`low_disk_transition`) and the free-bytes read
(`free_disk_bytes`) are split so the transition logic is unit-testable without a
real disk; `disk_tick(free)` takes injected free-bytes for the same reason.

This backstop stands alone now that #263 removed the shared cache — it is the
only structural mitigation left, not a second layer behind one. Option 2 from
the issue (auto-reclaim merged/idle worktrees) is mostly orchestrator
discipline and is left to the orchestrator/human for now.

## Tests

- `failed_task_write_leaves_board_intact` (Windows-gated): fault-injects a
  read-only `tasks.json` so the rename-over and the direct-write fallback both
  fail, and asserts the previous board is byte-for-byte intact and non-empty —
  the incident, reproduced without filling the disk. POSIX rename keys on
  directory write not file perms, so this injection is Windows-specific.
- `durable_writes_round_trip`: happy-path round-trip for `tasks.json` /
  `state.json` — atomicity didn't change semantics.
- `worktree_pane_env_never_injects_cargo_target_dir` (#263): a fixture linked-
  worktree tree, spawned through `apply_pane_env`, must carry no
  loomux-computed `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`; an operator-set value passes through
  untouched.
- `low_disk_transition_latches_once_with_hysteresis`,
  `low_disk_notice_reports_free_space`,
  `disk_tick_notifies_once_per_episode_and_skips_paused`: the latch, message,
  and per-episode/paused-skip behavior.
- `concurrent_audit_appends_land_as_whole_lines` (#240): 8 threads × 40 records
  with a fat detail payload through the real `audit` path; every line must parse
  and all 320 must survive. Fails on the pre-fix writer within one run,
  reproducing the incident's exact `""actionaction""::""agent-exit…` signature.
- `audit_rotation_racing_appends_loses_no_lines` (#240): appenders racing one
  mid-burst `rotate_audit_if_needed`; the union of both generations must hold
  every record, uncorrupted. Also red pre-fix — but note its redness comes from
  the *writer* (interleaved records), not the lock: it stays green if only the
  lock is removed. The lock's evidence is the test below.
- `concurrent_rotations_keep_the_retained_generation` (#240): two rotators
  staggered through the `set_rotate_check_pause_for_test` seam, with appenders
  refilling the fresh log between their renames; the retained generation must
  survive. This is the **lock's** reproducer — it's the one test the single
  `write_all` does not make pass. Red without `AUDIT_LOCK` (`left: 0, right: 50`
  — every seeded record gone), green with it.
- `parse_audit_lines_counts_what_it_skips` (#240): a spliced line is counted as
  skipped, a blank line is not, and the whole records still parse.
