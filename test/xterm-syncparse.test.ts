// #720, self-review finding: the render throttle made `markFirstInput` flush
// held output, and the ORDER of that flush relative to `humanOrigin.mark()` is
// load-bearing. This file pins the upstream xterm behaviour the ordering rests
// on, so the constraint is enforced rather than merely asserted in a comment.
//
// The hazard. `humanorigin.ts`'s entire correctness argument is that data the
// terminal manufactures for itself (a DA/OSC auto-reply) "arrives while its own
// `term.write()` is being parsed — always a different turn — and therefore
// always reads false". That holds only while every `term.write()` is parsed on
// a LATER task than the keystroke. `WriteBuffer.write` breaks exactly that when
// a write lands on an empty buffer right after user input — its `_didUserInput`
// fast path calls `_innerWrite()` inline to cut echo latency
// (@xterm/xterm/src/common/input/WriteBuffer.ts). So a flush called from inside
// `markFirstInput` AFTER the mark would parse synchronously, inside the marked
// turn, and hand the backend's keystroke clock a program-generated reply as a
// human keystroke — the #179/#518 failure, re-created by a perf change.
//
// pane.ts's fix is to flush BEFORE marking. These two tests are the A/B that
// shows the fast path is real and is armed by exactly the signal xterm's own
// `onKey` accompanies; if xterm ever stopped parsing synchronously there, the
// first test goes red and the ordering constraint can be revisited on evidence
// instead of being carried forever on a comment. Same "pin the upstream fact
// the fix leans on" shape as xterm-write-queue.test.ts and xterm-reflow.test.ts.
