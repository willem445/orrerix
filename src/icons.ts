// The icon registry, and the role→dye table that colours it (#879, slice K).
//
// WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS. loomux already drew its icons the right way — inline
// `currentColor` SVG strings in DOM-free TypeScript, no icon font, no sprite sheet, no
// dependency — but it drew them in four places (pane.ts, fileicons.ts, fileexplorer.ts,
// and ad-hoc glyphs in the views), each hand-authored to a different stroke weight and
// grid, and every one of them inheriting the surrounding text colour. That is a set of
// marks, not a system: nothing said which icons belong together, and nothing could say it,
// because they all came out the same grey.
//
// So this module owns two decisions, and they are separate on purpose:
//
//   1. WHAT THE MARK LOOKS LIKE — a vendored Lucide glyph (see §Vendoring), verbatim.
//   2. WHAT IT MEANS — a ROLE, and through the role an identity dye (see §The role table).
//
// COLOUR IS ASSIGNMENT, NOT ASSET. No icon body below carries a colour: they are
// `currentColor` line art, and the hue arrives from a CSS class this module stamps onto the
// `<svg>` element (`.ic-<role>` in styles.css, one `var(--id-*)` each). Recolouring the app
// therefore never touches an SVG, and a consumer cannot pick a hue — it picks a MEANING and
// the table picks the hue. That is the whole reason the role sits in the registry rather
// than in an argument at the call site: doc/design/ui-redesign.md's maintainability rule 3
// allows an `--id-*` token only "through a documented role mapping, never ad hoc", and a
// per-call override would be exactly the ad-hoc route it refuses.
//
// DOM-free on purpose: test/icons.test.ts imports this directly (no jsdom, no bundler), and
// the strings are injected with `innerHTML` by whoever needs them, exactly as before.

/**
 * §Vendoring — where the artwork comes from, and the rule for changing it.
 *
 * Lucide (ISC), vendored VERBATIM at the pin below: each body is the inner markup of the
 * upstream `icons/<name>.svg`, copied unmodified, with only its line breaks collapsed. The
 * wrapper this module builds carries Lucide's own `viewBox`, `stroke-width`, caps and joins
 * unchanged too, so the glyphs keep the geometry they were drawn for and a re-vendor is a
 * diff a reviewer can read against upstream.
 *
 * NOT an npm dependency, deliberately: the redesign plan's no-new-dependency line holds, the
 * copy is auditable in-tree, and nothing in the build has to resolve an icon package. The
 * cost is that a re-vendor is manual, which is what the pin and the provenance file are for
 * — `src/vendor/lucide/` carries the ISC licence text, the icon list and the procedure, and
 * THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md carries the shipped-in-repo entry. The commit below appears in all
 * three, and test/icons.test.ts fails if the three ever disagree.
 *
 * ONLY ICONS THAT ARE USED MAY BE VENDORED. A vendored asset nobody renders is a licence
 * obligation with no benefit, and the set grows silently if nothing checks; the test walks
 * `src/` and refuses an entry below that no surface asks for.

/**
 * §The role table — eight roles, eight hues, one claim each.
 *
 * A role answers the identity channel's question (doc/design/ui-redesign.md, §The three
 * colour channels): *which thing is this?* — never *what state is it in*. That is why no
 * role below names a `--state-*` token or the accent: an icon that reports agent state
 * takes its colour from the POSITION it sits in (the warp thread, the status chip, the state
 * dot), which belongs to the surfaces C–I paint, not to this registry. Keeping the two
 * apart here is what lets the app get much more colourful without diluting the four signals
 * a supervisor has to read across ten panes.
 *
 * THE BIJECTION IS THE DISCIPLINE. Each of the eight identity hues is claimed by exactly one
 * role, so a hue IN AN ICON resolves to one meaning rather than to "one of the two or three
 * families that happen to be amber". Scoped to icons on purpose, and the scope is not a
 * hedge: the same four hues are claimed again by the agent-role table (azure/jade/violet/
 * amber = orchestrator/worker/reviewer/planner, pinned by test/theme.test.ts), so a hue is
 * one meaning per surface, not one meaning app-wide. docs/core-concepts.md says the same
 * thing to users. It is also what stops the table from growing: a ninth
 * family cannot be added by minting a ninth colour (the brief measured eight as the ceiling)
 * — it has to argue its way into an existing role or displace one. test/icons.test.ts
 * enforces the bijection in both directions.
 *
 * The per-CLI hues (theme.ts §CLI_HUES, `--cli-*`) are the one set that ever got past that
 * ceiling, and they got past it by NOT joining this table: a CLI could not take a role's hue
 * without giving that hue a second meaning, which is the bijection's whole point, so it has
 * its own tokens and its own pin (test/agenticons.test.ts). Nothing below changes — the roles
 * are still eight, still bijective, and a `.cli-*` rule never meets an `.ic-*` one on the same
 * element.
