// The launch → starter-workers wire contract (#1020 item 5). Run with `npm test`.
//
// WHY THIS IS A SOURCE SCAN, AND WHY IT IS HERE AT ALL.
//
// Item 5's promise is that a launch opens NO worker panes. `starter_workers` pins the
// decision (src-tauri/tests/orchestration/) and that is the half a unit test can reach.
// The half it cannot is the one that makes the decision *apply*: the launcher expresses
// "no starters" by OMITTING the `initialWorkers` key, which is only 0 because the backend
// argument is `Option<u32>` and tauri maps a missing key to `None`. That contract spans the
// IPC boundary — no test in this repo crosses it (rev-740 verified the tauri-side behaviour
// by reading `tauri/src/ipc/command.rs`), so nothing else would notice it breaking.
//
// And it breaks SILENTLY in the direction that matters. Change the argument back to a plain
// `u32` and every suite stays green — `cargo test` never invokes the command, and the
// frontend never type-checks against Rust — while the first real launch fails at the IPC
// layer with an `InvalidArgs` error for a missing field. That is a defect no reviewer would
// see in a diff that "just tightened a type".
//
// **The behavioural test this replaces could not exist, and finding that out is the point.**
// The spawn loop that opens starters runs in `register_orchestrator_pane`'s post-bind
// thread, and that thread is never started headlessly: `if reg.app.lock_safe().is_none() {
// … return Ok(request) }` returns before it (commands/panes.rs), because a bind needs a frontend pane.
// A test asserting "no workers appeared" after a headless launch is therefore VACUOUS — it
// passes whatever the default is, including a re-introduced 2. Driving it needs a real
// `AppHandle` (`set_app`), which an integration test cannot construct. So this pins what is
// actually pinnable: the shape that carries the decision across the boundary.
//
// It is a TEXTUAL scan and enumerates its own limits, the way the groupid scans do: it
// matches the argument declaration and the invoke payload as written today. A macro-built
// argument list, an aliased type, or a payload assembled from a spread would slip past it.
// None exists today — don't be the first.
