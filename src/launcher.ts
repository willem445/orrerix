// The in-pane welcome / pane-setup surface (#194). Shown on a fresh start, a new
// tab, and a pane split: the user picks what the pane becomes —
//   Agent        — one or N coding-agent CLI panes (a worktree name fans out to
//                  name-1 … name-N so every agent gets an isolated worktree)
//   Orchestrator — an orchestrator pane + N idle workers with guardrails
//                  (max live agents, pinned models, permission mode)
//   Terminal     — a plain shell; the shell-kind picker spawns PowerShell, cmd,
//                  or Git Bash (#194 P2). Git Bash is enabled only when a
//                  Git-for-Windows install is discovered (else disabled, with a
//                  reason surfaced on the option).
//   File explorer— a PTY-less pane hosting a native-style file MANAGER rooted at a
//                  folder (#214): browse, open a file in the OS default app for its
//                  extension, new folder / rename / delete, jump-to-file by name.
//   File editor  — a PTY-less pane hosting the #174 file tree + code editor + #207
//                  search, rooted at a folder (#217). The Alt+F overlay, as a pane.
//   Git          — a PTY-less pane hosting the git view over a repo (#217): graph,
//                  status, diffs, staging, #208 worktree switching. The Alt+G
//                  overlay, as a pane.
//   Workflow     — a PTY-less pane over the repo's workflow file (#222): the
//                  agent blocks a run may use, the advisory path between them, and the
//                  enforced merge gate. Rooted at the repo; the file need not exist yet.
//
// The CONTENT kinds take exactly one input — the folder / repo — and it is
// validated for REAL before the pane is made (does the directory exist? is it a git
// work tree?), so a typo'd path shows an inline error instead of a broken pane.
//
// This replaces the old modal launcher AND the global "agent mode" toggle: there
// is no global mode anymore, every pane declares its kind here at creation. The
// form is DOM; the kind-selection + validation core is the pure `panesetup.ts`
// (unit-tested). The form owns worktree creation so a failure surfaces inline and
// the user can fix the name and retry instead of losing their input.
