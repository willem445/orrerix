//! The pure discovery core of `src-tauri/src/sessions.rs` (#888 slice A4,
//! batch 14) — locating a CLI's session store, reading one session's record out
//! of it, and resolving a session's own recorded working directory by id.
//!
//! Claude Code:    `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-path>/<uuid>.jsonl`
//! Copilot CLI:    `~/.copilot/session-state/<uuid>/workspace.yaml`
//! pi:             `~/.pi/agent/sessions/--<encoded-path>--/<ts>_<uuid>.jsonl`
//! codex:          `~/.codex/sessions/<YYYY>/<MM>/<DD>/rollout-<ts>-<uuid>.jsonl`
//!
//! Everything here is best-effort in the same sense the whole scanner is:
//! unreadable or malformed entries are skipped, and a missing tool simply
//! yields nothing.
//!
//! **This is an item lift, not a file split.** `src-tauri/src/sessions.rs`
//! keeps its `#[tauri::command]`s (`list_sessions`,
//! `record_{claude,copilot}_launch_posture`), the launch-intent posture store
//! behind them, the `session-index.json` cache, the candidate machinery and the
//! opencode scanner — all of which reach `crate::uistate`, `crate::opencodedb`,
//! `crate::blocking` or Tauri itself. What crossed is the half none of that
//! touches: `std` + `serde_json` + `dirs`, plus [`crate::groupid::GroupId`] and
//! [`crate::pathseg::PathSegment`], both already on this side.
//!
//! The staying half calls back in through a curated item-list re-export
//! (#988) in `src-tauri/src/sessions.rs`, which copies each item's old
//! visibility keyword rather than publishing a module — see that file's
//! re-export block for the table.

// ---------- codex (#2515 C2) ----------
//
// Codex keeps one JSONL "rollout" file per thread, under a date-directory tree
// inside its own home:
//
//     $CODEX_HOME/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-<ts>-<thread id>.jsonl
//
// Facts pinned against `openai/codex` at tag `rust-v0.153.4`, read blob by blob
// through the GitHub blob API; quoted in `doc/design/codex.md`. Three of them
// shape everything below, and two are corrections to what this slice was
// planned from (posted on #2515 before any of this was written):
//
//  1. THE DATE DIRECTORIES ARE LOCAL-DATED. `precompute_new_rollout_path`
//     (`rollout/src/recorder.rs`) builds them from `OffsetDateTime::now_local()`,
//     so "today" has two answers either side of local midnight and a
//     UTC-derived guess is wrong for part of every day. Nothing here computes a
//     date at all -- `walk_codex_session_files` enumerates whatever directories
//     exist -- precisely so that question never has to be answered.
//
//  2. THE FILE NAME CARRIES TWO IDS, NOT AN ID AND A COUNTER. The slice plan
//     called the second half `_{n}`; `RolloutFileName::render`
//     (`rollout/src/rollout_file_name.rs`) emits
//     `format!("rollout-{timestamp}-{}.jsonl", self.thread_id)` when the thread
//     id and rollout id agree and
//     `format!("rollout-{timestamp}-{}_{}.jsonl", self.thread_id, self.rollout_id)`
//     when they do not -- which is what `thread/revert` produces. The trailing
//     half is a second UUID, so the id this module matches is not a fixed-width
//     field; see `codex_rollout_thread_id`.
//
//  3. A ROLLOUT OLDER THAN A WEEK IS COMPRESSED IN PLACE, and this is the fact
//     a `*.jsonl` walk gets silently wrong. `rollout/src/compression.rs` starts
//     `spawn_rollout_compression_worker` -- "a best-effort background job that
//     compresses cold local rollout files", fire-and-forget, with no
//     configuration gate -- and it rewrites `<name>.jsonl` to `<name>.jsonl.zst`
//     once `MIN_ROLLOUT_AGE: Duration = Duration::from_secs(7 * 24 * 60 * 60)`
//     has passed. A walk matching only `.jsonl` would therefore list the last
//     seven days of sessions and answer `Ok(None)` -- "no such session" -- for
//     every older one: the probe-the-wrong-shape, miss-reads-as-absent failure
//     this whole dispatch exists to fix, reproduced one file extension over,
//     and arriving on a schedule rather than by chance. Both representations
//     are walked; see `walk_codex_session_files` for what a compressed file can
//     and cannot answer.
