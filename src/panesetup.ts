// Pure pane-setup core for the welcome screen (#194). DOM-free: the welcome
// form (launcher.ts) collects raw control values into a PaneSetupInput, and this
// module decides — per the chosen KIND — whether the setup is valid and what it
// should spawn. Every "the orchestrator needs a repo", "a worktree needs a
// repo", "a custom agent needs a command", count-clamping, and worktree fan-out
// rule lives here so it is unit-tested without a DOM (test/panesetup.test.ts).
//
// Phase 2 (#194) wires all three shell kinds (PowerShell / cmd / Git Bash) to
// real per-kind spawning. PowerShell and cmd are always available on Windows;
// Git Bash depends on a Git-for-Windows install, discovered backend-side. This
// module owns the pure kind→enable/disable mapping and the fallback resolver so
// the form logic is unit-tested without a DOM (test/panesetup.test.ts).
//
// #214 adds a FOURTH kind: `files` — a PTY-less pane whose content is the file
// MANAGER, rooted at a directory the user picks. Its only setup input is that
// root, and the only rule this module can decide is "a root was given"; whether
// the directory actually EXISTS is I/O, so the form probes it (ftRootIsDir)
// after this returns ok and surfaces a failure inline.
//
// #217 adds two more of the same family — `editor` (the #174 file tree + code
// editor, rooted at a folder) and `git` (the #208 git view, over a repo). All
// three are PTY-less CONTENT panes and validate the same way here: the path is
// mandatory, and its REALITY (a directory? a git repo?) is I/O the form probes.
// The one asymmetry is what "real" means per kind — a folder for files/editor, a
// git work tree for git — which is why the probe stays in the form and only the
// "a path was given" rule lives here.

// #222 adds a FOURTH content kind: `workflow` — the pane that makes
// the workflow file (the user-defined agent workflow: blocks, edges, gates)
// configurable. Its one input is the REPO the workflow file lives in, so it validates
// exactly like its three siblings: the path is mandatory here, and whether it is a
// readable directory is I/O the form probes.

// #887 (slice S3) adds an EIGHTH kind: `ssh` — a pane whose process is a local
// ssh.exe client connected to a remote host, optionally launching an agent CLI
// there. Its declaration is an SSH PROFILE (sshprofile.ts, slice S1), and the
// argv it spawns is built by the pure builder (sshcommand.ts, slice S2); this
// module is the seam between them, so the whole compose path is unit-tested
// without a DOM. What it validates is what only it can: that a profile was
// chosen at all, and that the destination is still one ssh will read as a HOST
// rather than as an option.

// Explicit `.ts` on both (the convention promote.ts / sessionroute.ts document):
// these are VALUE imports in a module `node --test` loads directly, so they have
// to resolve without a bundler.

 *  nothing in loomux can stop it — an unaccountable agent left running on someone

 *  spending remote credits unattended. Putting the gate at the one function every

 *
 *  `release()`, not `finish()`: a reconnect that FAILED must stay retryable — the

 *  it. This latch is therefore never permanently spent, which is why the one-shot

 *     loomux mints ids for (`sshMintsSessionId`, i.e. claude). A profile switched

 *     nowhere to put it, and in both cases the id names a conversation on the far
 *     host that the new CLI cannot read anyway.
 *   - With no recorded id (a remote copilot/opencode pane, a login shell, or a
 *     claude pane whose id was never captured) it is a plain fresh connect. For a

 *     itself resumable next boot, the same way `agentFreshCommand` keeps a local

 *  keeps this module pure and its fresh/resume split unit-testable.

 *  merge gate at all — a security regression, and the reason this is a refusal

 *  writes names local paths.
 *
 *  **Both inputs are read by one rule: the UNION of the two sides, field by
 *  field.** A pane spawn has two sources of truth — the `opts` describing what it
 *  is about to become, and the pane's own existing state — and a guard that read
 *  ssh-ness from both while reading the orchestration identity from only one
 *  would have a hole exactly the width of that asymmetry: an ALREADY-orchestrated

 *  through and spawn an ssh client inside a live group member (PR #921 review,
 *  rev-441). Neither side is authoritative alone, so neither is trusted alone.
 *  Doing the merge HERE rather than at the call sites is the other half of that:
 *  the rule is in the module that is unit-tested, not in two DOM call sites that
 *  can drift apart.
 *
 *  Nothing in the spawn path builds this combination today: the backend's spawn
 *  requests carry a role and a command, never a pane kind or an SSH profile, and
 *  the group surfaces never offer one. This exists so that stays true — a future
 *  edit that wires an SSH profile into a delegate spawn fails loudly at the pane,
 *  before any process starts, instead of quietly producing a group member whose
 *  merge gate isn't enforced. Fail-closed by construction: it refuses on ANY
 *  orchestration marker from EITHER side, so a spawn that carries only half an
