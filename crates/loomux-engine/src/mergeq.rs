//! The bisecting merge queue — **pure core** (#581 slice C).
//!
//! Design note: `docs/design/merge-queue.md`. Section references below (§4, §6,
//! §8, §9, §11.3, §11.4) point into it; that note is the spec this file
//! implements and the argument for every choice made here.
//!
//! # What lives here, and what deliberately does not
//!
//! Everything in this module is a **pure function over values**. There is no
//! I/O, no `git`, no `gh`, no clock and no filesystem: the queue's decisions —
//! which entries go into a batch, which half a bisect tests next, whether the
//! merge gate still holds — are the part that has to be deterministic and
//! test-pinned, so they are separated from the part that talks to the world.
//! The driver that pushes the scratch ref, opens the draft PR, observes the
//! checks and lands the batch is slice D; it consumes this module and supplies
//! every external fact as an argument.
//!
//! **No code path in this file writes anything anywhere.** Not a ref, not a
//! file, not a PR. [`scratch_branch`] builds a *name*; nothing pushes it.
//!
//! # The two invariants this file exists to hold
//!
//! 1. **Eight states and no ninth** (§4). "Paused" is not a state — it is an
//!    eligibility predicate computed live from [`QueueEntry::blocked_reason`],
//!    because a persisted staleness flag is a claim that rots the moment the
//!    world moves. Every transition is enumerated in [`transition`] with the
//!    section that asks for it, and anything not enumerated is **refused**.
//! 2. **The queue is strictly additive to the merge gate** (§6). It never
//!    grants what the gate would not. [`recheck_gate`] therefore *calls* the
//!    shim's own parsers (`workflow::evaluate_merge_gate` and friends) rather
//!    than re-deriving the decision — a third implementation of the gate
//!    decision is a defect, not an optimization.
