// Pure, DOM-free core of the visibility policy for EVENT-DRIVEN views (#1318).
// The sibling of pollgate.ts, for the other half of `docs/design/performance.md`
// §3: pollgate.ts answers "this view has a TIMER — should it tick?", and this
// answers "this view has an EVENT STREAM — should a wake run a refresh?".
//
// WHY THE TWO NEEDED SEPARATING. Nothing on `EmbedEntry.hide` ever asked a new
// view this question. Its doc comment said the hook was for "extra per-view
// cleanup beyond hiding its host", and closed with "Optional: most views need
// nothing beyond the generic hide" — an invitation to skip it. The rule that
// would have caught this was real but misplaced: it sat three thousand lines
// below, as a comment on ONE view's registration ("stops the follow poll on
// close/eviction ... which every POLLING view has to answer for", on the
// `timeline` entry since #648), where nobody adding a NEW view has any reason
// to look. `TasksView` and `DecisionsView` were then registered with no `hide`
// hook at all, so every `write_tasks` by every agent (plus every
// questions/needs-you write) drove a full refetch-and-rebuild in every board
// and every NEEDS-YOU panel that had EVER been opened on any pane in the
// session. `AuditView` missed it a third time from the other direction: it DOES
// poll, and its poll was still left running behind a closed panel. The rule now
// lives on the interface, and is about the question rather than the mechanism:
// **a view that can be woken from outside must say what happens when nobody is
// looking at it** — the waker being a `setInterval` or a Tauri `listen` is an
// implementation detail of the waking, not of the rule.
//
// SUPPRESS, DON'T CATCH UP. Unlike `PollGate`, this gate owes no catch-up run:
// the pane calls `show()` on every open in either hosting mode, and both views'
// `show()` already ends in a `refresh()`. So a wake dropped while hidden is
// re-earned by the act of looking — no staleness can survive being looked at,
// which is why the gate needs no missed-wake bookkeeping and no trailing run.
// The cost it accepts in exchange is named in docs/design/embedded-panels.md: a
// reopened panel shows its last render for one backend round-trip before
// repainting, where before it was already current.
//
// THE RELEASE IS NOT THE EVENT (the standing rule that a suppression driven by
// a fallible signal needs a release that does not depend on that signal —
// #496/#513/#518, and pollgate.ts's own note). `wake()`/`sleep()` are a LATCH
// driven by two calls the pane makes, and a latch that misses its release is a
// panel that silently stops updating while the human is looking straight at
// it. So the gate never decides from the latch alone: `confirm` is the pane's
// own authoritative "is this view on screen right now?" read, consulted on
// exactly the path where being wrong is expensive, and a wake that arrives
// while the latch says asleep but `confirm` says visible RUNS — and re-wakes
// the latch, so the gate self-heals instead of paying that read forever.
//
//   latch  | confirm() | outcome
//   -------+-----------+--------------------------------------------------
//   awake  | not read  | run       (union: one true input is enough)
//   asleep | true      | run, re-wake the latch, count a stray
//   asleep | false     | suppress
//
// The union direction is deliberate. A missed `sleep()` (latch awake, panel
// hidden) costs exactly what the pre-#1318 code cost — a refresh nobody sees —
// while a missed `wake()` would show a human stale data, so the gate errs
// toward refreshing. `confirm` is one map lookup and one `.hidden` read: no
// layout, no IPC, and it is only ever reached on a wake the gate is about to
// suppress anyway.

/** The pane's live read of whether this view's PANEL is open, in EITHER hosting
 *  mode. Injected rather than read off the DOM here so the policy stays
 *  DOM-free and the tests drive all four crossings directly. Must be cheap and
 *  must not force layout — it is called once per suppressed wake.
 *
 *  **What it can and cannot see, because everything below turns on this.** The
 *  shipped probe is `PaneEmbeds.isViewVisible`, which reads one element's own
 *  `hidden` attribute. That is exactly "is this panel open"; it is NOT "can a
 *  human see it". Two states put a view genuinely off screen with that
 *  attribute untouched, and the gate keeps working in both: a background
 *  project tab (`Workspace.setVisible(false)` sets `display:none` on an
 *  ancestor) and a minimized pane (`pane.el` is detached, not hidden). Neither
 *  calls any pane method that could move the latch. So the bound this module
 *  delivers is **"a closed panel costs one boolean"**, not "an off-screen one":
 *  a board left open in a background tab still pays the full refetch and
 *  rebuild on every agent write. That residual is #1465, and it is a real
 *  visibility signal pushed down from the tab/grid layer, not a clause — the
 *  cheap probes are all barred, since `offsetParent`/`getBoundingClientRect`
 *  force layout (the contract above) and `isConnected` catches the detached
 *  case but not `display:none`. */
