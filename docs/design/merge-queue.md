# Design: Bors-style bisecting merge queue (#581)

Status: **implemented.** This note is slice B of #581 and gated every later slice; the plan
(#581 comments, planner `plan-151`, parts 1–7) made the note a hard prerequisite for slice C.
Line numbers were written against `main` at `d8667d4`; symbols are the durable reference,
lines are a convenience.

Slices: **A** `Task.pr_base` (parallel with this note) · **B** this note · **C** `mergeq.rs`
pure core + `merge_queue:` parsing · **D** the driver (D1 write primitives, D2 loop
functions, **D3** the tick that calls them — §13, #698) · **E** MCP tools + docs · **F**
read-only UI.

## Two decisions recorded here, both deliberately reversible

Both were flagged by the plan as the calls a human may want back, and both were adjudicated
on #581 under the batch-2 autonomy grant. They are recorded as **decisions**, not open
questions — each with the alternative that lost and the seam that makes reversing it cheap.

1. **Batch construction is a merge-commit scratch ref, not squash replay** (§8). The losing
   alternative and the one-function reversal seam are written down there.
2. **The backend pushes refs and opens draft PRs — new authority, accepted** (§3). Bounded,
   namespace-scoped, loud on failure, default off.

## 1. Problem & thesis

CLAUDE.md constraint 7's carve-out (#469) lets an orchestrator merge approved sub-PRs into a
**non-default integration branch it owns**, so a human reviews one combined PR instead of
five. Today that path is sequential and unguarded *at the batch level*:

- Sub-PRs merge one at a time, by hand, as each one's own gate clears.
- The gate is **per-PR**. The `gh` shim (`orchestration/mod.rs::gh_shim_sh:361`, gate body
  ~705–960) mechanically refuses `gh pr merge` until every reviewer the workflow gate names
  has recorded a `pass` against the PR's *current head*. That is real enforcement, and it
  says nothing whatsoever about the **combination**.
- N individually-green sub-PRs can therefore produce a **red integration branch** — a
  semantic conflict, a test that only fails when two changes coexist, a lockfile that
  resolves differently once both are present.
- When that happens there is **no attribution**. The orchestrator sees red and bisects by
  hand, or guesses.

This is the one place loomux's thesis — *gates enforced from outside the agent process* —
stops short. The per-PR gate refuses mechanically; the batch has no gate at all.

**Thesis:** extend outside-the-agent enforcement from the PR to the combination. Before a set
of approved sub-PRs reaches the integration branch, the host merges them speculatively onto a
scratch ref, lets the repo's own CI judge that exact object, and lands **that same object** on
green. On red it bisects and attributes mechanically, so no human and no agent has to guess
which change broke the combination.

The queue is a **gate**, not an accelerator. It exists because a green sub-PR is evidence
about a PR and not about a branch — the same distinction the lessons file records for CI
citations ("green is a fact about a SHA, not about a PR"), applied one level up.

**Not in scope**, each for a reason:

- **Anything touching the default branch.** Constraint 7; §7 is the structural proof.
- **Loomux running builds or tests.** Constraint 8; §5 — the queue *observes* verification,
  it never defines or invokes it.
- **Auto-briefing the culprit's worker from the backend.** §9 — attribution is mechanical,
  routing is orchestrator judgment.
- **Any change to how sub-PRs are reviewed.** The workflow gate is reused, not replaced (§6).
- **The per-PR human grant path** (`mod.rs:943–960`) stays byte-for-byte untouched.

## 2. Prior art

- **Bors** (rust-lang) — the original speculative-merge queue. Batch *k* approved PRs onto a
  scratch ref, run CI **once** for the batch, fast-forward on green, bisect on red. Its
  central invariant is the one this design keeps: *the commit that was tested is the commit
  that lands.* Everything else here is plumbing around that sentence.
- **Gastown's Refinery** — a per-project merge-queue processor that batches merge requests
  from completed workers, runs verification gates, and merges Bors-style. It is the component
  that lets Gastown run 20–30 agents without a human serialising every merge. Surfaced in the
  July 2026 landscape review that produced #581; Gastown and `gh-aw` were the only two
  systems found with host-enforced gates comparable to loomux's, and the bisecting queue was
  the main primitive loomux lacked.
- **GitHub's native merge queue — rejected**, for three independent reasons, any one of which
  is disqualifying:
  1. **It is branch-protection shaped.** Enabling it requires a protection rule on a
     long-lived branch plus repo-admin (often org-level) setup. Integration branches here are
     **ephemeral and orchestrator-owned** — minted for one batch of work and deleted after
     the human squashes them into `main`. Provisioning a protection rule per ephemeral branch
     is not a workflow anyone would run.
  2. **It is default-branch oriented.** The native queue merges into the protected branch.
     That is precisely the branch constraint 7 forbids this feature from touching, and
     pointing it at an integration branch instead means re-creating the protection scaffolding
     described above for each one.
  3. **It moves merge authority out of the host.** The whole point of the shim, the workflow
     gate, and the audit log is that enforcement lives where an agent cannot reach it *and*
     where loomux can compose it with its own gate (§6) and record it (§11). A GitHub-side
     queue would land merges loomux neither authorised nor audited.

  What the native queue does well and this design copies anyway: speculative batching, the
  "tested is landed" guarantee, and dequeuing the culprit rather than the whole batch.

## 3. Ownership & authority

**The queue runs in the loomux backend.** Not in an orchestrator's context, not as a
procedure an agent follows.

Why the backend:

- **Host-enforced.** An agent enforcing its own gate is exactly what #151 taught against, and
  it is the reason the merge gate is a `PATH` shim rather than a paragraph in a template.
- **Deterministic.** Batch composition, bisect steps, and refusals are pure functions with
  tests, not a model's judgment on a given day.
- **Restart-durable.** A batch outlives the app (§4). An orchestrator-run queue dies with a
  compact.
- **Free.** It burns no agent tokens; a batch that takes 40 minutes of CI costs zero context.

**New authority, named honestly.** This is the first time the backend writes to the outside
world on its own initiative, and that deserves to be stated rather than buried:

- **The backend pushes git refs.** Precedent: `src-tauri/src/git.rs::git_push:454` already
  pushes with the user's ambient credentials. What is *new* is that the queue chooses the
  refspec rather than a human pressing a button. Bounds: the only two refspecs the queue ever
  constructs are `<sha>:refs/heads/loomux/mq/<batch-id>` (the scratch) and
  `<scratch-sha>:refs/heads/<validated-target>` (the landing); the landing push is
  **fast-forward only** — never `--force`, never `+` — so a target that moved under the batch
  makes the push *fail* rather than overwrite (§10).
- **The backend creates and closes draft PRs via `gh`.** Precedent for the mechanism:
  `src-tauri/src/gh.rs::gh_output:69` — `Command::new("gh")` with an **arg vector**, never a
  shell string, `current_dir` validated, `NO_COLOR`/`GH_PAGER`/`GH_PROMPT_DISABLED` set,
  `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` on Windows. What is new: every existing `gh` call in that module is a
  **read** (`gh_pr_list`, `gh_pr_view`, `gh_activity`). This is loomux's first backend write
  to GitHub, and it is limited to draft PRs whose head is in the `loomux/mq/*` namespace,
  plus one comment on a culprit PR (§9).

Bounds on the new authority, all of them testable:

- **Default off** (§12). An absent `merge_queue:` block means behavior is byte-for-byte
  unchanged.
- **Namespace-scoped.** The queue creates, and deletes, only refs under `loomux/mq/*`, by
  exact name built from the batch id — never a pattern sweep (§10).
- **No unbounded retry.** Every external call gets one attempt per state transition; failure
  moves the entry to a terminal state, audits, and surfaces. The lessons file's rule — *any
  suppression driven by a fallible signal must be bounded* — is why there is no "keep trying"
  arm anywhere in this design.
- **Loud.** Every push, PR creation, landing, refusal, and cleanup failure is an audit event
  (§11) and, where it changes what the orchestrator should do, a decision-grade notice.

**Rejected alternative: an orchestrator-run queue procedure** — the queue as a template
section the orchestrator follows. Rejected on three counts: it costs tokens proportional to
batch size, it is compact-fragile (a queue that forgets its in-flight batch is worse than no
queue), and it puts gate enforcement back inside the agent process, which is the #151 lesson.

## 4. State & lifecycle

**`merge_queue.json`**, one per group, in the group dir beside `state.json`, `tasks.json`,
`queue.json`, and `audit.jsonl`. Versioned (`version: 1`), atomically written, unknown fields
tolerated on read so an older build can load a newer file without destroying it.

**Entry states:**

    queued ──> batching ──> ci-wait ──> landing ──> landed
                  │            │           │
                  │            └──> bisecting ──> kicked-back
                  │                                    │
                  └──> kicked-back (conflict)          └──> (survivors) queued
    (any non-terminal) ──> cancelled

- `queued` — enqueued and eligible in principle; not yet in a batch.
- `batching` — selected into the batch currently being constructed.
- `ci-wait` — the scratch is pushed, the draft PR is open, checks are being observed.
- `landing` — checks are green and the gate is being re-verified at the moment of submit (§6).
- `bisecting` — the batch went red and this entry is inside the search.
- `landed` / `kicked-back` / `cancelled` — terminal.

**"Paused" is not a state — it is an eligibility predicate, computed live.** The plan
(part 2, answer 3) requires that an entry whose PR got rebased stops being batchable, because
a rebase moves the head and every verdict binds to a commit, so the passes die. Modeling that
as a state would mean *persisting* a fact that is only true relative to the PR's head right
now, and a persisted staleness flag is a claim that rots the moment the world moves. Instead
the entry stays `queued` and carries a `blocked_reason: Option<String>` refreshed at every
batch build; a `queued` entry with a blocking reason is skipped, shown to the human with that
reason, and becomes eligible again the instant a re-review covers the new head. **Eight states
and no ninth**, none of them lying.

**One in-flight batch per target.** Bors discipline: dispatch as soon as the queue is
non-empty and nothing is in flight — no timed accumulation window, entries pile up naturally
while a batch runs. Two reasons beyond simplicity: the fast-forward invariant (§8) is trivial
to reason about when only one batch can be racing the target head, and a single in-flight
batch makes the crash-reconcile question ("what was happening when we died?") have exactly
one answer.

**One target per group in v1 — and a PR whose base is not that target is refused, never
silently retargeted.** `merge_queue.json` carries a single `"target"` (§11.3) and
`merge_queue_status()` returns one, so the queue is one-target-per-group; the note is explicit
about how that target comes to exist, because "how does the queue know where it is landing"
is otherwise a question slice C would have to answer by inventing:

- The target is **established by the first successful enqueue**, from that PR's live
  `baseRefName` (resolved as §7.1 describes, and subject to every refusal there).
- It is **released when the queue drains** to zero entries with no batch in flight. A target
  is a property of the work in the queue, not a configured setting — nothing in
  `.loomux/workflow.yml` names a branch. "Drains" is one predicate (`mqloop::drained`) asked
  at every transition that can be the last one out — a finished or abandoned batch, a cancel,
  a reconcile that strands what it cannot resume — because no single one of those owns the
  event.
- **The drain takes the finished work with it**, for the same reason it takes the target:
  a finished campaign's `cancelled` and `landed` rows describe work the queue is no longer
  doing. They were previously dropped only by `prune_terminal` at a **land**, which a campaign
  that ends in cancellation never reaches — so a cancelled batch left rows the pane went on
  counting (`mergeqview::project` reports `entries_total = state.entries.len()`; the
  agent-facing `status_view` filters terminal entries and never showed them).
- **`kicked-back` survives the drain**, and the asymmetry is the point. The three terminal
  states are different kinds of fact: `cancelled` is a request that has been honoured,
  `landed` is work that succeeded, and `kicked-back` is the queue telling an owner something
  they have **not acted on yet**. The drain is exactly when someone looks, so deleting it
  there would leave "strand loudly" alive only in the audit log — and a pane showing nothing
  is not loud.
- **Terminal entries are bounded, drained or not** (`MAX_TERMINAL_RETAINED`, oldest dropped
  first): not zero, per the kick-back argument above; not unbounded, because `project` renders
  the first `VIEW_ENTRY_LIMIT` entries **in file order** and enough corpses would push the live
  ones out of the window. `MAX_ENTRIES` does not bound this — it counts only non-terminal
  entries.
- A later `queue_merge` whose live base is not the current target is refused with
  `base-not-target`. Not queued-for-later, not a second queue, and above all **not a silent
  retarget** — the entries already queued were approved against a different branch, and
  moving the target under them would land them somewhere nobody reviewed them for.
- **That refusal is asked about the same predicate, at the read.** A recorded target binds a
  new enqueue only while the queue is *not* drained; on a drained queue the enqueue
  establishes, exactly as the first one did. The rule protects entries, and a drained queue
  has none — so a residual target there refuses every future branch with "drain it first"
  said about a queue that is drained, and `merge_queue.json` is persistent by design, so no
  restart clears it (#710). Belt and braces on purpose: the release above keeps the file
  honest going forward, and this makes the wedge unreachable at the decision even for a file
  some other path (or an older build) left a target in.
- `queue_merge`'s optional `target` argument (§11.1) is an **assertion, not a selection**: if
  present it must equal the target the base resolves to, and mismatches refuse. Caller-supplied
  input can narrow what happens, never widen it — the same posture constraint 6 takes on every
  other agent-supplied argument.

Multi-target queues are deliberately out of v1. When they arrive they are a map of
target → queue, which is why the target lives in the state file rather than in config.

**Restart reconcile — the #467/#468 pattern, copied deliberately.** The delivery queue learned
this the hard way; `mod.rs::recover_persisted_queue:31842` is the shape to mirror:

- **Two phases.** Phase 1 runs under a once-only guard held across the whole phase (the
  `HashSet::insert` doubles as the check): read the file, parse, classify entries into
  resumable and stranded, audit both. Nothing inside phase 1 may deliver or enqueue — the
  mutex is not reentrant. Phase 2, after the guard drops, sends the notices phase 1 collected.
- **Batch-id non-reuse is enforced against the remote, not against a counter.** The delivery
  queue's version of this step advances a monotonic `queue_seq` past the highest id on disk,
  and that is the right guarantee *for ids that are a sequence*. Batch ids are not (§11.4):
  they are `RandomState`-derived, with no ordering and no maximum to advance past, so the
  analogous guarantee has to take a different form here. Reuse is a virtue right up to the
  point where it changes what a check means — this is the second place in this note where
  that bites, the first being `default_base_ref` (§7).

  What is actually at risk is a **remote object**: `refs/heads/loomux/mq/<group>-<batch-id>`
  colliding with a **leaked** scratch ref from an earlier batch — the exact ref §10 permits
  cleanup to leave behind ("a leaked scratch ref is cheap"). A fresh batch pushing onto a
  leaked ref of the same name is the one way this design can end up testing an object it did
  not construct, which is the Bors invariant (§8) failing at the one point §8 does not guard.
  So:

  1. **Refuse to mint a batch whose scratch ref already exists on the remote** — one
     `git ls-remote --exit-code` per mint. On collision, re-mint; bounded at 3 attempts, then
     fail the batch loudly (`mq-scratch-collision`). The colliding ref is **never deleted to
     make room**: a ref loomux cannot account for is not a ref it gets to overwrite, and
     blind deletion is precisely the sweep hazard §10 forbids.
  2. **The scratch push is create-only, so the check is not load-bearing.** A check-then-act
     leaves a window; the act itself has to be the enforcement. This is the #532 rule (§6)
     applied to a ref instead of a gate — verify at mint, and re-verify *inside the operation
     that writes*.

     **"Create-only" is a named primitive, not a property a plain push has.** A plain
     `git push origin <sha>:refs/heads/loomux/mq/<id>` does **not** provide it: if the leaked
     ref happens to be an **ancestor** of the new scratch, the push is a fast-forward and
     succeeds **silently** — verified empirically in review of this note, and it is the exact
     case the collision check is for, since a leaked scratch built on an older head of the same
     target is a plausible ancestor rather than an unrelated object. Non-fast-forward rejection
     is therefore not the guarantee; it only catches the *divergent* half of the failure. Use
     one of:

     - `git push --force-with-lease=refs/heads/loomux/mq/<id>: origin <sha>:refs/heads/loomux/mq/<id>`
       — the **empty** expect value after the colon means "expect this ref not to exist", so
       the push is rejected outright if it does. Note the trailing colon is the whole
       mechanism; dropping it turns the lease into an ordinary force push, which is the
       opposite of what is wanted.
     - or `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/refs`, which is server-side create-only and returns
       **422** when the ref already exists.

     **Slice D asserts this at the argv level** — a test on the exact argument vector handed to
     `git`/`gh`, not on the resulting ref — because every way of getting this wrong degrades to
     a *silently successful* ordinary push, and an outcome-only test ("did the ref end up at the
     right SHA?") passes in exactly the cases this bullet exists to prevent. Same posture §7.5
     takes on the landing refspec, and for the same reason.

  **Why not a persisted counter** (which constraint 2 would permit — it forbids getrandom
  crates, not counters): a counter's non-reuse guarantee is scoped to **loomux's own record**,
  while the object at risk lives on the **remote**. A counter is silently defeated by a leaked
  ref from a build whose `merge_queue.json` was lost, reset, or written by a version predating
  the counter — which is the crash case this whole section exists for. The remote check
  subsumes what a counter would cover *and* adds that case; a counter does not subsume the
  remote check. Ids therefore stay opaque and unordered, and nothing in the design is allowed
  to read meaning into one.
- **Reconcile against reality, not just the file.** For an entry in `ci-wait` or `landing`,
  the file says what loomux *intended*; the truth is whether the scratch ref still exists,
  whether the draft PR is still open, and where the target head is now. Resume only when the
  world matches the record; otherwise fail the entry **loudly** — audit, notice, terminal
  state. Never silently drop and never silently retry.
- **The snapshot is not deleted on read.** It is rewritten alongside live entries, so recovery
  is re-runnable across N restarts rather than being a one-shot that a crash mid-recovery can
  lose.

## 5. Verification contract

**The queue observes verification. It never defines or runs it.** "The repo's verification" is
whatever the repo's own CI config says, full stop — the same source the shim's `ci-green`
clause already trusts (`mod.rs:877–884`). No toolchain string exists anywhere in queue code.
A repo that builds with `make` needs zero loomux changes. This is CLAUDE.md constraint 8, and
it is the constraint that got the shared `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` removed (#263).

**The observation path: a draft PR from the scratch ref into the target, then poll its
checks.** Push `loomux/mq/<group>-<batch-id>`, open a **draft** PR into the integration
branch, and read its checks. Three reasons this shape and not another:

1. It reliably triggers PR-triggered CI in any repo whose CI runs on PRs — the exact
   assumption the shim's `ci-green` clause already makes.
2. It gives `gh pr checks` a handle, so the classification code that already exists gets
   reused rather than reinvented.
3. It gives the human a URL to watch, which is most of what "observability" means here.

**Reuse the existing classification — do not write a third.** Terminal-state logic exists
twice already: `notify::pr_checks_result` (with `check_is_pending` — **not** its immediate
neighbour `check_is_failing`, the predicate an implementer is most likely to grab by mistake
given the subject here) and `intake::parse_pr_list`. The `notify` module lives in
`crates/loomux-engine/src/notify.rs` as of #888 slice A2 batch 3 and is re-exported as
`orchestration::notify`; `intake` is in `src-tauri/src/orchestration/`. Both already encode the property that
matters most — **an empty check list is not success**, it is pending. `notify.rs` is the one
to build on, since it also handles the `"no checks reported"` stderr case.

One adaptation is needed and should be written as an adapter over that helper rather than a
fork of it: `pr_checks_result` returns `PollResult::Met` for a **failing** run as well as a
passing one, because for a *watch* "the checks resolved" is the event. The queue needs the
distinction, so it maps the same helper's output into a queue-shaped verdict:

    enum BatchVerification { Pending, Green, Red { failing: Vec<String> }, Unavailable }

Consuming the shared helper and narrowing at the edge keeps one definition of "pending" in the
codebase; re-deriving pass/fail from raw JSON would make three.

**The no-checks case is bounded, because an unbounded wait is the defect this repo keeps
re-learning.** A repo with no CI at all classifies as `Pending` forever. The lessons file's
rule is that *any suppression driven by a fallible signal must be bounded*, and its corollary
is that *releasing on evidence beats releasing on elapsed time*. So: the primary release is
the checks going terminal, and `checks_timeout_minutes` (default 60, clamped like the notify
TTLs) is the **backstop** — on expiry the batch surfaces to the orchestrator as
**unverifiable**, explicitly, rather than sitting pending in silence. Unverifiable is not
green: nothing lands.

**Rejected: watching `workflow_run` events / push-triggered runs directly.** Run-id discovery
after a push is racy, and push-triggered CI is not guaranteed by a repo that only runs CI on
PRs — which is the same repo shape the shim already assumes. A draft PR makes the trigger
explicit instead of hoping for one.

**Cost.** A green *k*-batch is **+1** CI run in total, since each PR already ran its own
checks. A red batch adds roughly ceil(log2 *k*) bisect runs — at the default `max_batch: 3`,
at most 2 extra.

## 6. Gate composition — one gate definition, two enforcement points

**The landing push is a merge the shim never sees.** The shim gates the `gh` binary *inside an
agent pane* via `PATH`; the backend is not an agent pane, and the landing verb is a `git push`
rather than `gh pr merge` in any case. If nothing else were done, the queue would be a hole
straight through the merge gate — an agent could enqueue a PR whose reviewers have not passed
and have the host land it.

So **the backend re-enforces the same gate itself**, by calling the same parsers the shim's
decision mirrors — never by reimplementing the decision:

- `workflow.rs::parse_gate_file:1876` — the gate definition (`require`, `reviewers`, `also`).
- `workflow.rs::parse_verdict_file:1524` — one recorded verdict: line 1 the verdict, line 2
  the **head sha it binds to**, line 3 timestamp, line 4 agent id, line 5 body digest.
- `workflow.rs::Verdict::parse:1298` and `is_blocking:1311` — `pass | fail | escalate`,
  lowercase-strict; anything else is `None`, and **one `fail` beats any number of passes**.
- `workflow.rs::evaluate_merge_gate:1775` — the decision itself.

Read against `verdicts/pr-<N>/<block>` plus the PR's live head. Three properties carried over
verbatim, because dropping any one of them would make the queue a weaker gate than the shim
it sits beside:

- **A stale pass is not a pass.** A verdict whose line-2 sha is not the PR's current head is
  stale (the shim's own `stale` arm, ~848). A rebase therefore silently disarms an entry —
  which is exactly the `blocked_reason` path in §4.
- **The body-digest asymmetry (#565) is preserved.** The shim digest-checks *passes* only
  (`mod.rs:886–922`, `workflow.rs::canonical_body:1432` / `body_digest:1447`). The queue does
  the same, so a PR body rewritten after its approvals cannot smuggle an unreviewed
  description into a batch.
- **`also: [ci-green]` still means the sub-PR's own checks.** The batch's checks are an
  additional signal, never a substitute for the per-PR one.

**Two enforcement points: batch build, and again at landing.** This is the #532 rule —
*re-verify every write gate at the moment of submit* — and it is not redundancy. Between
building a batch and landing it there is a full CI cycle, tens of minutes in which a reviewer
can record a `fail`, a PR can be rebased, or a body can change. Verifying only at build would
land a decision that was true half an hour ago.

One gate definition, two enforcement points, zero drift. **A third implementation of the gate
decision is a defect, not an optimization** — if the queue's needs ever diverge from the
parsers, the parsers move.

**No gate configured is a refusal, not a pass.** A repo can perfectly well set
`merge_queue: enabled: true` with no `gates:` block at all — that is the state of most repos,
and it is reachable on day one. `evaluate_merge_gate` with no gate returns *allowed*, which is
correct for the shim (an ungated repo merges normally, as it always did) and **wrong** for the
queue: it would mean the backend pushing approved-by-nobody PRs onto a branch under its own
authority, which is the one thing §3's new authority is not for. So `queue_merge` refuses with
`gate-not-configured` when no gate covers the target, and the batch build refuses the same way
if the gate disappears mid-flight.

The general rule this is an instance of, worth stating because it constrains every later
change: **the queue is strictly additive to the gate. It never grants what the gate would not,
and its own green is never a substitute for a reviewer's `pass`.** A queue that could land
something the shim would have refused is not a stronger gate, it is a bypass with better
telemetry.

## 7. Constraint-7 structural proof

Constraint 7: the queue must be **structurally incapable** of targeting the default branch.
Not "does not", *cannot*. Five layers, each independently sufficient, **none of them keyed on
agent-writable data**.

**A note on which lookup is authoritative.** The default branch used for these refusals is
resolved the way the shim resolves it — `gh repo view <repo> --json defaultBranchRef`
(`mod.rs:759`; note #294: the repo goes **positional**, not through `-R`). It is deliberately
*not* `git.rs::default_base_ref:631`, despite that being the obvious reuse: that helper
answers "what does local git think the default base is", derived from local refs after a
best-effort fetch, and local refs are not an authority a security refusal should rest on.
Reuse is a virtue right up to the point where it changes what a check means.

1. **Enqueue.** `queue_merge` resolves the PR's `baseRefName` and the repo default **live**,
   via the real `gh` — the same two lookups the shim makes at `mod.rs:750` and `759`. Base
   equal to default is refused. **A failed lookup also refuses**, mirroring the shim's
   `unverifiable-base` posture (`mod.rs:761–763`): unknown is never treated as safe.
2. **Batch build.** The target is re-resolved and re-checked against the default. Mismatch
   aborts the batch.
3. **Landing — the write.** Inside the *same function* that constructs the push, re-resolve
   default and target **at the moment of submit**, and only then build the refspec
   `<scratch-sha>:refs/heads/<target>`. This is what defeats the adversarial case: the default
   branch **renamed to the queue target's name** between build and landing. No code path
   anywhere constructs a push refspec from the default-branch name, and the landing function
   takes the validated target as its only branch input — there is no argument it could be
   handed that would make it write elsewhere.
4. **The only landing verb is a fast-forward push to the validated target.** The queue never
   calls `gh pr merge`, so it cannot reach the shim's default-branch arms at all, and the
   per-PR human grant path (`mod.rs:943–960`) is untouched byte-for-byte. Being ff-only also
   means a target that moved makes the push fail rather than overwrite.
5. **Tests pin the refusals**, in `src-tauri/tests/orchestration.rs`: enqueue against the
   default refused; batch build against a target that became the default aborted; the
   adversarial rename refused at step 3; a lookup failure refused rather than defaulted; and
   the landing function's refspec asserted to be exactly `<tested-sha>:refs/heads/<target>`.

**What this proves is half of constraint 7's carve-out — say so, so slice C does not guess.**
The five layers prove the queue cannot target the **default branch**. Constraint 7's carve-out
is narrower than that: a non-default branch **the orchestrator owns**, typically an integration
branch. **Ownership is not modelled here, and that is intentional** — nothing above would stop
the queue targeting a release branch, another worker's feature branch, or a human's WIP.

Two reasons it is the right bound for v1. First, **parity with the shim**: `mod.rs:929-931`
already lets any non-default merge through without a gate grant, so an ownership check here
would be loomux enforcing on the queue path something it does not enforce on the path the
queue replaces — a difference that would push work back to the unguarded route. Second, and
more importantly, **§6 is what actually makes an unowned target safe**: every PR in a batch has
satisfied the repo's own merge gate, re-verified at landing. Ownership would answer "who may be
landed *into*"; the gate answers "what may be landed", which is the stronger question.

If an ownership check is ever wanted, it is a **narrowing** applied at §7.1 (enqueue) and §7.2
(batch build) beside the existing default-branch refusal, with a new `target-not-owned`
refusal in §11.1 — and it needs a durable notion of orchestrator branch ownership, which does
not exist today. Written down so that slice C neither invents one nor omits one a reader
expected.

**`Task.pr_base` (slice A) is a hint, never a gate input.** It is agent-writable board data.
It exists to make the Approve-button relabel accurate (`docs/orchestration.md`) and to let the
queue *display* a base without a `gh` round-trip. Every decision above re-resolves live. The
field's doc comment says so, so it never gets promoted into a gate input by a future reader
who sees a convenient string sitting there. This is the constraint-6 lesson applied to a field
instead of a command argument.

## 8. Batch construction & the Bors invariant — DECIDED

**Decision: the scratch ref is the current integration head plus one merge commit per queued
PR head, in queue order.** Adjudicated on #581; recorded here with its loser and its seam.

    scratch = target_head
    for entry in batch:            # queue order, deterministic
        scratch = merge(scratch, entry.pr_head)   # conflict -> kick back, no CI spent

Land with `git push origin <scratch-sha>:refs/heads/<target>`, fast-forward only.

**Why: the SHA that was tested is the SHA that lands.** That is the Bors invariant and it is
the entire point of the feature. CI ran on `<scratch-sha>`; the object that becomes the new
integration head *is* `<scratch-sha>`, byte for byte, not a rebuild that resembles it. A
second benefit falls out free: each sub-PR's head becomes reachable from its base, so GitHub
marks those PRs **merged** on its own, with no extra API calls and no manual closing.

**Rejected alternative: per-PR squash replay** — squash each PR onto the target in turn after
a green batch. It is genuinely attractive: it matches this repo's stated linear-history
preference, and it is what a human does by hand today. It loses on the invariant. Replay
**rebuilds** every SHA, so what lands is not what CI tested — the batch's green becomes
evidence about commits that no longer exist, which is the precise failure the queue was built
to prevent. It also needs manual PR closing, since no replayed commit contains the PR's head.

Linear history is preserved where it actually matters: **the final human squash of the
integration branch into `main` keeps `main` linear**, exactly as it does today. The
merge-commit noise lives only on an ephemeral integration branch that is deleted after that
squash.

**The reversal seam.** The choice is isolated in **one function**, `build_scratch`
in `crates/loomux-engine/src/mqloop.rs` (slice D2; #888 batch 12b moved it out of
`orchestration/`). It is *not* in `mergeq.rs`, as this note
originally said: `mergeq.rs` is the no-I/O pure core, and building a scratch needs
a runner, so the seam belongs in the driver layer. Corrected here because §8 is
precisely the artifact a future reverser follows.

    fn build_scratch(r: &dyn MqRunner, batch_id: &str, branch: &str, target: &str,
                     heads: &[(u64, String)]) -> ScratchBuild

Nothing outside it knows how the scratch was built; every downstream stage takes a SHA.
Reversing to squash replay is a rewrite of that function and its tests — **plus** the landing
verb, since replay cannot land by ff-push of a single tested SHA. That second half is stated
here so a future reverser does not discover it halfway through: the seam makes reversal
contained, not free.

**Conflicts cost no CI.** A merge that conflicts during construction kicks that entry back
immediately, before anything is pushed; the batch rebuilds without it.

### The squash-merge auto-close gotcha, restated

Already-documented territory, restated because the queue changes where merges happen and a
reader here will be reasoning about merge commits:

- GitHub's closing-keyword scan (`close`/`fix`/`resolve` immediately followed by `#N`, any
  inflection, anywhere in the body or the aggregated commit message) fires on merge **into the
  default branch**. Batch merge commits reach only the **integration** branch, so a stray
  `Closes #N` in a sub-PR body **cannot** fire at batch landing.
- It fires later, at the **final human squash of integration → `main`**, whose aggregated
  message carries every sub-PR's text — and it will close whatever it names, however partial
  that PR's scope actually was. The precedent is on the record: #569 and #590 were both
  auto-closed with real scope still open, and #569 a second time by a PR that linked
  `Part of #569` deliberately and still tripped the scan on a sentence *asking a human* to do
  it by hand.
- **The queue does not scrub bodies.** Rewriting agent- or human-authored PR text to defuse a
  keyword is loomux editing the record, which is worse than the problem. The owner of the
  final squash message stays the human who performs it.
- **The queue's own text is loomux-authored and must never contain the pattern.** The batch
  draft PR body lists its sub-PRs as bare `#N` references with no keyword in front of them,
  and the culprit comment (§9) does the same. That is a rule the batch-body builder's tests
  pin, not a habit.

## 9. Bisect & attribution

**Mechanical attribution host-side; routing judgment orchestrator-side.**

The search, on a red batch:

- **k = 1** — that PR is the culprit. No further CI.
- **k > 1** — split the batch in half, build a scratch from the first half, run it, and
  recurse into the half that reproduces red. ceil(log2 k) runs; at `max_batch: 3`, at most 2.
- Bisect depth is bounded by `max_batch`, so the search always terminates.

On a culprit:

- **A comment on the culprit PR** — the durable record, where a human or the owning worker
  will actually look: failing check name, run link, batch id, and the sibling set. All
  gh-sourced text passes through `notify::sanitize_gh_text`, the same sanitizer every
  crossing-text boundary in this codebase uses.
- **One decision-grade notice to the orchestrator.** One fact that changes what it does next,
  plus the PR link — not a narration.
- **Survivors are auto-requeued**, at the front, preserving their original order. They were
  never implicated; making them wait behind newly-enqueued work would punish them for a
  neighbour's failure.

**It does not auto-brief the owning worker.** Worker liveness, resume-versus-fresh-spawn, and
folding this feedback with whatever else is pending are judgment calls, and the board mapping
`pr → assignee/session` that equips them belongs to the orchestrator. The backend produces the
*fact*; the orchestrator makes the *call*.

**Honest limit: bisect finds _a_ culprit, not necessarily _the_ culprit.** A genuine pairwise
interaction — A fine alone, B fine alone, red together — attributes to whichever entry the
search isolates, which depends on the split. The comment says so in as many words and names
the batch id and the sibling set, so the reader can see the interaction rather than being told
a half-truth confidently. Overclaiming here would be exactly the "a claim is a deliverable"
failure the lessons file records.

**A batch that is still red at k = 1 while that PR's own checks are green** is surfaced as an
infrastructure/flake case — a notice saying so — not looped on. Same bound as everywhere else.

## 10. Failure modes & bounds

Every row below is a designed path, an audit event (§11), and a test.

| Failure | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Push auth failure | Batch aborts, entries return to `queued`, cleanup runs, orchestrator notice, audit. **No retry loop.** |
| `gh` not installed | `gh_output`'s `"gh-not-found"` sentinel (`gh.rs:69`) propagates; the queue reports itself **unavailable** rather than silently doing nothing. |
| Merge conflict during construction | That entry kicks back immediately; batch rebuilds without it. **No CI spent** (§8). |
| CI never attaches / repo has no checks | Bounded by `checks_timeout_minutes`; surfaces as **unverifiable**. Nothing lands (§5). |
| Target head moved under an in-flight batch | The ff-only landing push **fails**. Batch aborts, entries requeue, next build starts from the new head. Never `--force`. |
| Gate re-check fails at landing | Landing refused, that entry kicks back, survivors requeue (§6). |
| Crash mid-batch | Reconcile from `merge_queue.json`: verify the scratch ref exists, the draft PR is open, and the target head matches. Resume only if the world matches; otherwise fail entries **loudly**. Never drop silently (§4). |
| Entry cancelled while `batching`/`ci-wait` | The in-flight batch is abandoned and rebuilt without it; cleanup runs. |
| Scratch ref already exists at mint (leaked from a crashed earlier batch) | Refuse to mint on that name; re-mint, bounded at 3 attempts, then fail the batch loudly (`mq-scratch-collision`). The existing ref is **never** deleted to make room. The push is create-only — `--force-with-lease=<ref>:` with an empty expect, or `POST /git/refs`'s 422; a *plain* push would fast-forward onto an **ancestor** leaked ref silently — so the check has no TOCTOU window (§4). |
| Queue grows without bound | Entries are capped (`64`); enqueue past the cap is refused with a stated reason, keeping `merge_queue.json` bounded. |

**Cleanup runs on every exit path** — green, red, conflict, timeout, cancel, crash-reconcile,
and abort. Close the draft PR, delete the scratch ref. Two rules on the deletion:

- **Namespace only.** Only refs under `loomux/mq/*` are ever deleted, by **exact name** built
  from the batch id — never a pattern sweep, never a glob, never "delete branches matching".
  A cleanup routine that can be talked into a wildcard is a data-loss bug waiting for its
  input.
- **Cleanup failure never blocks landing and never fails a batch.** It audits
  (`mq-cleanup-failed`) and leaves a ref behind, which the next reconcile can see. A leaked
  scratch ref is cheap; a batch held hostage by a failed `git push --delete` is not.

## 11. Public contracts

Each item below is a **public contract** in the CLAUDE.md sense — a command signature, a wire
shape, a file format, or a persisted schema — and this note is their design note.

### 11.1 MCP tools (three, orchestrator-role-gated)

Built via the `add-orch-tool` skill so every layer moves together. Role gating uses the
`review_verdict` **double-gate** precedent: a cosmetic listing filter *and* a real dispatch
check, because a tool omitted from a listing is still callable.

    queue_merge(pr: number, target?: string)
      -> { queued: true, position: n } | { refused: "<reason>" }
      refusals: base-is-default | base-unverifiable | base-not-target | gate-not-met
              | gate-not-configured | already-queued | queue-full | queue-disabled

    merge_queue_status()
      -> { enabled, target, entries: [{ pr, state, blocked_reason?, since_ms }],
           batch?: { id, prs, state, draft_pr, checks } }

    cancel_queued_merge(pr: number)
      -> { cancelled: true } | { refused: "<reason>" }

### 11.2 The `merge_queue:` block in `.loomux/workflow.yml`

A sibling of the existing `gates:` block, parsed in `workflow.rs` alongside it:

    merge_queue:
      enabled: true                 # default false
      max_batch: 3                  # default 3
      checks_timeout_minutes: 60    # default 60, clamped like the notify TTLs

**An absent block means the feature is off and behavior is byte-for-byte unchanged** — the
same posture `gates:` takes. Parse errors are **loud**, following the existing
`workflow-invalid` audit path; a malformed block never degrades to defaults, because a queue
running on silently-substituted policy is a queue nobody can reason about.

**Adding the block breaks the file for builds that predate slice C — deliberately.**
`RawWorkflow` is `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` (`workflow.rs:593-620`), so `merge_queue:` is
not a tolerated unknown key on an older build: it fails the parse of the **whole**
`.loomux/workflow.yml`, gates and all, down the loud `workflow-invalid` path. This is a real
property of the opt-in and not a footnote — §12's "delete the block and the feature is off"
is true, but the converse is not symmetrical, and anyone adding the block to a repo whose
users may run mixed versions should know that before they push it.

It is the right behavior anyway. `workflow.yml` is **human-authored policy**, and a key the
build does not understand means a human believes a policy is in force that is not — silent
tolerance there is the exact silent-degradation failure the loud parse exists to prevent.

Note the **deliberate asymmetry** with §11.3, since the two persisted surfaces this design
adds take opposite forward-compatibility postures and a reader will otherwise infer one from
the other: `merge_queue.json` **tolerates** unknown fields, because it is **machine-authored
state** and an older build must be able to read and rewrite it without destroying what a newer
one wrote. Policy fails loud; state degrades gracefully. Different documents, different jobs.

*A correction to the plan worth recording:* the plan and CLAUDE.md constraint 8 both cite "the
way the resource guard's `resources:` block does" as the precedent. **That block does not exist
in `workflow.rs` today** — constraint 8 names it as the intended pattern, not as shipped code.
So `merge_queue:` follows the *principle* (loomux carries the mechanism; the repo declares what
is guarded, expensive, or built here) and the *shape* of the block that does exist, `gates:`.
Stating this here so the next reader does not go looking for a parser to copy.

### 11.3 `merge_queue.json`

    {
      "version": 1,
      "target": "feat/integration-batch-2",
      "entries": [
        { "pr": 612, "head": "<sha>", "state": "queued",
          "blocked_reason": null, "enqueued_ms": 0, "batch": null }
      ],
      "batch": { "id": "mq-7f3a", "prs": [612, 613], "scratch_sha": "<sha>",
                 "draft_pr": 640, "state": "ci-wait", "started_ms": 0,
                 "bisect": null }
    }

`bisect` is present **exactly when the batch is a bisect probe** rather than a batch that
might land (§13), and carries `{ "origin_prs": [...], "failing": [...] }` — the original red
batch's members and its failing check names. Added by slice D3; additive and defaulted, so a
file written before it still reads and one written after it survives an older build's
read/write cycle through the `extra` map above.

Unknown fields are tolerated **and preserved** — carried across a read/write cycle rather than
merely not failing the read, because §11.2's promise is that an older build can read *and rewrite*
this file without destroying what a newer one wrote, and a field that is ignored on read is lost
on the next write. And the file is never deleted by recovery — rewritten alongside live entries,
the #467/#468 posture.

### 11.4 The scratch-ref namespace

    refs/heads/loomux/mq/<group>-<batch-id>

**Reserved.** Nothing else in loomux writes under `loomux/`, and the queue writes nowhere else.

Batch ids come from the std `RandomState` idiom — **no getrandom-based crates** (constraint 2;
see the notes in `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`). They are **opaque and unordered**: not a sequence, not
monotonic, and carrying no "which batch came first" meaning that any code may read. Non-reuse
across a restart is guaranteed by the remote check in §4 (refuse to mint onto an existing ref,
create-only push), **not** by advancing a counter — §4 argues why, and the two specs have to be
read together.

### 11.5 Audit events

Emitted through the registry's `audit(group, actor, action, detail)` (`mod.rs:17668`), kebab-
case, matching the existing convention (`queue-recovered`, `merge-gate-allowed`, …):

`mq-enqueued` · `mq-enqueue-refused` · `mq-batch-built` · `mq-batch-aborted` ·
`mq-batch-pushed` · `mq-checks-green` · `mq-checks-red` · `mq-checks-unverifiable` ·
`mq-landed` · `mq-land-refused` · `mq-bisect-step` · `mq-culprit` · `mq-kicked-back` ·
`mq-cancelled` · `mq-cleanup-failed` · `mq-scratch-collision` · `mq-recovered` ·
`mq-stranded`

`mq-batch-aborted` is slice D3's addition, for §10's "batch aborts, entries return to
`queued`" rows — a batch that could not be constructed, or one abandoned because a member
was cancelled. It exists rather than being folded into `mq-batch-built` with a falsy field
precisely because of the rule in the next paragraph: a filter looking for batches that were
built must not match a batch that was not.

Every state transition and every external write appears here. An audit action must name what
actually happened — labeling a failed landing as a success is the exact defect class #461
catalogues.

### 11.6 Frontend surface (slice F)

One read-only Tauri command `orch_merge_queue` plus a typed wrapper in `src/orchestration.ts`
(constraint 5 — the frontend never touches IPC directly), feeding a DOM-free
`src/mergequeue.ts` model. Presentation is **overlay/chrome only — never a PTY resize**
(constraint 1).

*Correction, made in slice F:* this line said `src/pty.ts` when it was written, echoing
constraint 5's own shorthand. That shorthand names the **rule** (every backend capability is
a command plus a typed wrapper, and no other module invokes) rather than a file: `pty.ts` is
the PTY-lifecycle/session bridge, and all ~50 `orch_*` wrappers already live in
`orchestration.ts` — which is the seam an orchestration read belongs on.

## 12. Rollout

- **Product default: off.** No `merge_queue:` block, no behavior change anywhere. This is not
  a soft default — it is the reversal mechanism (see the last bullet below).
- **Enabled per repo**, in that repo's `.loomux/workflow.yml`, exactly like `gates:` — but note
  that **adding the block is not inert to older builds**: `deny_unknown_fields` makes its mere
  presence a hard parse failure of the whole file on any build predating slice C (§11.2). The
  opt-in is reversible; it is not version-transparent.
- **Ordering** (plan part 7): A ∥ B → C (gated on this note's sign-off) → D (also needs A;
  both touch `mod.rs`) → E; F after C, parallel with D/E. Slices A, D and E serialize on
  `mod.rs`/`mcp.rs`; the queue engine is a new file (`mergeq.rs` — `queue.rs` is
  taken by the delivery queue) precisely so `mod.rs` touches stay wiring-only. That file lives
  in `crates/loomux-engine/src/` as of #888 slice A2 batch 6, alongside `mergeqview.rs`;
  `mod.rs` re-exports both, so `orchestration::mergeq` and `orchestration::mergeqview` still
  name them and every path in this note holds.
- **Dogfooding this repo is a proposal, not a consequence of this note.** A `merge_queue:`
  block for loomux itself is drafted in slice E for the human to accept or decline. Turning
  the queue on for the repo that develops the queue is a decision with its own risk, and it is
  not one a design note gets to make on the human's behalf.
- **`templates/orchestrator.md` gains a queue-mode addendum** (slice E): the
  "Merges onto non-default (integration) branches are never gated" line (`:673`) gains a
  when-queue-enabled clause. (This note used to also say the **"Re-sync the fleet"** section
  gets the observation that the queue *reduces* the O(n²) fan-rebase pressure it warns about;
  #1844 replaced that section — the rebase rule it carried is gone, and what remains true is
  the queue's speculative merge **is** the mergeability probe for sub-PRs onto an integration
  branch, with only a real conflict kicking back.)
- **Reversal:** delete the yml block and the feature is off; with `enabled: false` every queue
  code path is unreachable, and a test pins that. The two flagged decisions have their own,
  narrower reversal seams (§3, §8).

## 13. The driver tick — slice D3 (#698)

Slices C, D1 and D2 built the queue's core, its write primitives and its loop functions.
**None of them was ever called.** In the first live run the queue accepted four approved
sub-PRs, and 51 minutes later every entry still read `queued`: no `batching` transition, no
scratch ref, no draft batch PR, and an audit log holding four `mq-enqueued` lines and nothing
after them. `build_scratch`, `observe_batch`, `walk_bisect`, `advance_entry`,
`requeue_survivors` and `finish_batch` had no callers outside `mqloop.rs` and the test suite;
the frontend is a read-only view; nothing anywhere started a batch when entries were queued
and the target was idle. Every slice test drove a seam directly, so everything was green
while no production path connected them — the failure class this repo's lessons file opens
with, and the one #661's `e20` was written for.

This section is the missing path, and the two decisions it had to make.

### 13.1 Where it runs: a step in the unified `gh` poll loop

`mqloop::drive` is the decision half — one function over `(&dyn MqRunner, &mut
MergeQueueState, policy, gate, verdicts)` — and `OrchRegistry::mq_drive_group_with` is the
registry wiring around it. `gh_poll_tick` (#406/#652) calls the tick.

That loop and not a thread of its own, for three reasons. Observing a batch's checks **is** a
`gh` poll — the same `gh pr checks` call, on the same 30-second cadence, as every
`notify_when` watch. #406's whole point was one loop with one shared rate-limit-aware
scheduling policy, and a second `gh`-calling thread would re-open the coupling it closed. And
a batch's steady state is cheap: one `gh pr checks` on the draft PR, per wake, for the one
group with a batch in flight.

**The per-tick bound is one group per wake, oldest-serviced first.** Structural rather than a
counter, and it is the same constraint #656 imposed on the loop's other two halves: the loop is
shared with every watch in the fleet, so a driver that serviced N groups on one wake would put
N batch builds inside one tick. Ordering by last-serviced makes the rotation fair — a group is
deferred, never starved — which is `due_intake_polls`' idiom applied to a third half. Within a
group, a tick performs **at most one state advance**: it never loops waiting for anything,
never sleeps, and never retries an external call in place.

**A stalled seam ends the pass; a refused PR does not.** The counts above bound how many calls
a tick makes, and that is not the same as bounding how long it holds the loop. The selection
pass examines up to `MAX_EXAMINED_PER_BUILD` entries, and against a remote that is *answering
slowly* rather than refusing, each one burns a full `MQ_CMD_TIMEOUT` — the counts hold and the
clock does not, which is the property the fleet actually feels, since the same loop delivers
every `notify_when` notice. So the pass distinguishes **who** failed, exactly as §6's landing
path already does (`backoff = culprit.is_none()`): a `MqRunner` error is a fact about the world
— the next entry costs the same again and answers nothing — and ends the pass with a backoff,
while a refusal the remote actually answered with is a fact about that PR and the next entry is
a fresh question. `mqdriver::ResolveFailure` carries the split; the closed §11.1 vocabulary is
unchanged, because a caller deciding whether *this PR* may be queued still sees
`base-unverifiable` either way. The phase is bounded at **one** timed-out call.

**Every child is bounded, through #656's own primitive.** `MqRunner`'s process implementation
spawns `git` and `gh` inside that shared loop, so an unbounded wait there would park every
`notify_when` notice in the fleet — the exact failure #656 closed for `gh_capture`. It reuses
that machinery rather than repeating it: `capture_raw_with_timeout` (split out of
`capture_with_timeout` for this) does the null stdin, the two concurrent pipe drains, the
bounded wait, the kill with its own bounded reap, and the process-wide abandoned-reader
ceiling; the queue reads its result differently, because `git ls-remote --exit-code` answers a
question *with* its exit code and cannot have a non-zero exit collapsed into an error. One
implementation of the delicate part, two readings of its result. `MQ_CMD_TIMEOUT` is longer
than `GH_CAPTURE_TIMEOUT` (60s vs 20s) because a batch build is a fetch plus one merge per
sub-PR against a real working tree rather than a single API read — and it is still a bound the
worst case has to live inside, since a hung call parks the loop for its duration.

Beside the per-tick bound there is a **rate** bound: the group is held off for five minutes
(`MQ_DRIVE_BACKOFF_MS`) after any tick whose next attempt would cost the same external calls
and reach the same answer. Two shapes qualify. **An external failure** — §10's failure rows
all end "entries return to `queued`", which means the very next wake tries the same thing, so
a remote that is simply down would produce one notice and one audit line every 30 seconds.
And **nothing eligible to batch** — establishing that costs two `gh` round-trips per examined
entry (§7's live lookups) and a queue can sit blocked on a re-review for hours, so re-deriving
it every wake would be hundreds of `gh` calls an hour for a group doing nothing.

It is deliberately not a retry *limit* (§10 requires the entries to requeue and a later batch
to re-derive the question) and deliberately not persisted: the condition is a fact about the
world, not about the queue, and a durable backoff would keep punishing a batch for a network
that has since come back. Nothing is waiting on the latency it adds either — the human action
that unblocks a blocked entry takes longer than the backoff does.

### 13.2 How the bisect runs when no tick may block

§9 describes the search as a recursion whose step is a full CI run. `walk_bisect` states that
shape executably — and its `reproduces` closure can only ever be a build-push-observe cycle,
which is tens of minutes. Inside a shared poll loop that is not a function that can be called.

So the search is a **state machine across ticks**, and the state is the batch record: each
round is itself a batch, built over the half `bisect_step` selected, and the red set is
whatever is left in `bisecting`. A round's observation narrows the set — into the probe's
subset if it reproduced, into what the probe left out if it did not — the exonerated side
requeues immediately (§9's survivors, in their original queue order), and either the next
probe is built or the culprit is named. It terminates because the suspected set strictly
shrinks, and it spends the same ceil(log2 k) runs `walk_bisect`'s test pins.

Two consequences worth stating, because both are places where an obvious implementation is
wrong:

- **A probe never lands, even when it is green.** Its green is evidence about *attribution*,
  not a decision about the target: the entries in it are still in a search, and §9 requeues
  survivors for a later ordinary batch rather than landing halves as it goes. `BatchRecord`
  carries `bisect: Option<BisectSearch>` as the single source of that distinction, so the
  record's state and its search data cannot be read as disagreeing.
- **The search's `origin_prs` and `failing` are carried, not recomputed.** Attribution
  routinely happens on a tick whose own observation was **green** (the probe exonerated its
  half, so the culprit is the other half) — that tick has no failing checks to report, and by
  then every sibling has gone back to `queued` where it is indistinguishable from newly
  enqueued work. §9 requires the culprit comment to name both the failure and the sibling set,
  so both travel with the search. Nothing on the remote still holds them: §10 closes the draft
  PR and deletes the scratch ref on every exit path.

### 13.3 The invariant that keeps a crash recoverable

**An entry is in an in-flight state only while `state.batch` is `Some`.** Every path that
clears the batch record first moves its entries out of the in-flight states, and every path
that puts entries into one records a batch in the same call — which is why a bisect probe
carries a batch record of its own rather than the search running *between* batches.

That is what makes §4's reconcile a statement about a **crash** rather than about a tick that
was midway through its work. `reconcile_batch` strands an in-flight entry with no batch
record; if the driver could produce that shape legitimately, every restart would kick back a
set of innocent PRs. `mq_drive_group_with` therefore also runs `merge_queue_reconcile_with`
**before** driving — once-only, so it costs nothing after the first call, but it makes
recovery-before-driving a guarantee instead of an assumption about which bind site ran when.

**The whole record is validated before any name is built from it.** `merge_queue.json` is a
file, so a torn write or a hand edit can put anything in it, and the tick interpolates two of
its strings into paths and argv. The **target** reaches a refspec (the batch fetch's
`+refs/heads/<target>:…` runs long before §7.3's submit-time guard), so it is checked with
`landable` — the same predicate the landing path uses. The **batch id** reaches three places,
and only one of them was ever closed: `scratch_branch` validated it and cleanup refused to
guess at an unbuildable name, but `scratch_worktree_path` picks where `git worktree add`
creates a directory and `body_file_path` picks where the PR body is written, and both took it
raw. It is checked with `mergeq::valid_id_component` — `scratch_branch`'s own component check,
named rather than inlined, so the three interpolations cannot drift apart.

**Where that check lives is the whole point.** Both checks run at the top of `drive`, which
stops a bad record on one audit line rather than at whichever builder happens to be reached
first — but the *guarantee* is in the builders. `scratch_worktree_path` and `body_file_path`
apply `valid_id_component` themselves and return `None` on a name they will not build, because
a check that lives only in the guard is **positional**: it holds for the callers that happen to
sit after it, and `merge_queue_reconcile_with` runs *before* it in the same tick, handing
`cleanup_worktree` a batch id straight off disk. A guard is an ordering claim; a builder that
refuses is a structural one, and only the second survives a caller added later.

Refusing the tick rather than repairing the record is deliberate: a record loomux will not
build a name from is also one it cannot clean up by name, so acting on it would leak whatever
the real batch was. It audits and backs off — a loud, rate-bounded "a human has to look at this
file" — rather than guessing.

Two more registry-level facts the driver forced:

- **Every read-modify-write of `merge_queue.json` is serialized** (`mq_state_lock`). The
  driver's load-decide-store can span a whole batch build; without the lock a `queue_merge`
  landing in that window reads the pre-build file and writes it back, erasing the batch
  record. That lost update's symptom is a queue that accepts work and never lands it — #698's
  own symptom, one layer down.
- **The runner is injectable** (`mq_runner_override`, the `pr_head_override` precedent). The
  thing #698 was about is the *production entry point*, and that entry point resolves its own
  runner. Without a seam there a test could reach the driver or reach the poll loop, but never
  both at once — which is exactly the gap that let the door stay connected to nothing.
