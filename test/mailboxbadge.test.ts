// Unit tests for the manager pane's unread-mail chip presentation (#1161 M5).
//
// What these are FOR, since a label test is the easiest tautology to write: the
// chip exists because the manager pane is the one pane no fleet traffic is
// delivered into (`deliver_prompt` permits only the two kickoffs and D2's
// post-compact re-grounding notice), so news reaches it by pull and the human is
// the clock. Each test below pins a
// property whose loss would make the chip fail that brief — the count survives
// with the mouse nowhere near the pane (#813's lesson), an empty mailbox renders
// NOTHING rather than a zero, and the tooltip states the pull model rather than
// restating the number a human can already see.
//
// Run with `npm test`.

// ── the seed latch, scanned as text (#1502 review N6) ──
//
// `src/pane.ts` and its satellite `src/panebadges.ts`, where the latch now lives
// (#3498 F1), have no test file of their own — this repo hand-validates DOM
// wiring rather than simulating a DOM — so without this scan every claim about
// the seed latch would rest on `tsc --noEmit` alone.
//
// That residual is stated STRUCTURALLY, and deliberately not as a list of which
// mutation modes a type-checker misses (CLAUDE.md): an enumeration of modes is a
// SAMPLE of an open set — deletion, polarity, placement, operator swap, operand
// substitution, and whatever the next round names — so "the compiler catches A
// and B but not C" generalises from whichever cases somebody happened to try.
// The checkable statement is the structural one: THIS MODULE HAS NO TEST FILE,
// nothing executes it, and so every claim about it rests on what a type-checker
// and a text scan can see between them.
//
// A source scan closes the polarity half, and it has direct precedent here:
// `test/agenticons.test.ts` scans `pane.ts` as text and scopes the scan to ONE
// method's body, for the reason quoted in its own doc — a consumer scan that can
// be satisfied by the wrong line elsewhere in a ten-thousand-line file is a pin
// that reads like coverage and isn't.
//
// This scan's own residual, stated because it cuts against the technique: it decides
// partly on a binding's NAME, which CLAUDE.md warns is a shape a rename steps
// over. It is benign only because a PARTIAL rename fails `tsc` — `mailPushed` is
// read here and written in `setMailUnread`, so renaming one and not the other
// does not compile — and a COMPLETE rename fails this test loudly with the
// message below rather than silently passing.
