//! Integration tests for the engine-driven review driver (#1778 S3/S4).
//!
//! Design note: `doc/design/review-driver.md`. The pure core's own properties
//! are pinned inline in `crates/loomux-engine/src/reviewdrive.rs`; what lives
//! here is everything that needs a **crate boundary** or the registry — the
//! tick's wiring, the interception arms, the tools, and the brief rendering.
//!
//! # Why a new file rather than `tests/orchestration.rs`
//!
//! The plan on #1778 named `tests/orchestration.rs`, and its parenthetical says
//! why: CLAUDE.md constraint 4, integration tests rather than unit tests,
//! because a test executable linking the full lib needs the comctl32-v6
//! manifest `build.rs` embeds through `-tests`-scoped link args. A new
//! integration-test *target* satisfies that identically — the reason is the
//! target kind, not the file name. What a new file also avoids is the
//! end-of-file append conflict CLAUDE.md catalogues on that file: every test
//! block there ends `);` + `}`, so two branches appending to a 33k-line file
//! get that tail matched as common context and each side arrives ending
//! mid-assertion. `tests/mergequeue.rs` is the standing precedent for giving a
//! subsystem its own file, and this subsystem has slices still to land.
//! `tests/smoke.rs` is untouched, per that same constraint.
//!
//! No test here spawns a real agent CLI (constraint 3) or a real `git`/`gh`
//! child.

///
/// # Why this is default-deny on the ASK rather than a denylist of verbs
///
/// The driver reaches the outside world through exactly one method — `gh`, with
/// an arg vector — so every external action it can take is an argv, and every
/// argv's first two tokens are the ask. Enumerating what it MAY ask denies every
/// forbidden ask at once, including `gh api`, `gh pr comment`, `gh pr close` and
/// whatever `gh` ships next. A denylist would have to have anticipated each.
///
/// It is also the axis CLAUDE.md requires: the decision is the argv's SHAPE and
/// its first tokens, never the name of the function that built it. Renaming
/// `pr_facts_argv` changes nothing here; adding a new argv builder fails until
/// its ask is argued onto `ALLOWED_ASKS`.
///
/// # The residual, stated because a scan must state one
///
/// **A landing verb the driver reaches through a shared helper it does not
/// own.** The `git` half is closed structurally — `rddrive::RdRunner` has no
/// `git` method, and the one bridge to the wider trait answers `git` with a
/// refusal — so the compiler, not this scan, enforces that half. The `gh` half
/// is bounded but not closed: an argv assembled at runtime from a config value,
/// or one built inside a helper in another module and handed to the driver, is
/// invisible here. None exists today.

/// where `spawn_agent_bound` records the `task` it was given.
///
/// **This is the driver's own render path and not a copy of it**, which §5.5
/// makes the difference between a pin and a decoration: "a test that sanitizes
/// inside its own render harness asserts only that the two functions compose,
/// and passes identically while the live call site hands `render_template` a raw
/// job name".

/// Line endings normalised — `workflow.rs`'s own `lf`, for its reason.
///
/// The brief templates are `include_str!`'d, so they carry whatever line endings
/// the checkout has. That USED to split by platform — LF on the Linux and macOS
/// runners, CRLF on the Windows one under this project's `core.autocrlf=true`
/// baseline — so a byte-for-byte golden written with `\n` passed on two platforms
/// and failed on the third, which was a fact about the checkout rather than about
/// the rendered brief. Since #1845 `.gitattributes` pins
/// `src-tauri/src/orchestration/templates/**/*.md` to `eol=lf`, and the driver
/// briefs live there, so that split is gone on a correct checkout and this call is
/// a no-op over them — a safety net for a worktree cut before the pin, where they
/// are still CRLF on disk.
///
/// **It is still LOAD-BEARING for the hostile-value test, and the pin does not
/// change that.** A stray `\r` is a CONTROL CHARACTER, so an assertion that no
/// control character survived into a brief would otherwise fire on the template's
/// own line endings rather than on anything the sanitizer let through. Normalising
/// first is what makes that assertion about the interpolated VALUE, which is what
/// it is for. Note this replaces the `\r\n` SEQUENCE only, so a lone `\r` still
/// fails — deliberately, and `eol=lf` cannot substitute for it: git's `text` filter
/// converts CRLF pairs and leaves a lone CR untouched at both ends.

// ── #1861: the invariant behind the all-lanes `briefed_head` clear ──────────

/// **#1861.** The resume out of `held(lane-stalled)` clears `briefed_head` for
/// EVERY lane, not just the stalled one. That is safe only because **the
/// deciding lane is verdict-selected** — and nothing pinned it.
///
/// If selection ever consulted the lane RECORD instead of the verdict — a
/// routing change, a new lane kind, a gate that counts differently — the
/// all-lanes clear silently becomes "re-brief every lane on every resume": a
/// delegate spawned per lane per resume, review rounds burned with no worker
/// turn, and nothing red.
///
/// **Why this is pinned here and not on the resume arc.** #1861 proposes a
/// two-lane seam fixture where only one lane is stalled. That fixture cannot be
/// made to fail, and the previous author had already worked out why and left the
/// analysis on `a_resume_re_briefs_the_lane_that_stalled_rather_than_waiting_on_it_again`:
/// `first_stale_lane` skips a standing pass before any lane record is read, so
/// the passed lane is unreachable from the re-open under every implementation —
/// and making it reachable means staling its pass, at which point IT becomes the
/// deciding lane and the test stops being about the stall. The operands cannot
/// collide on that arc. They collide here.
///
/// **The collision.** Both lane records are put in the SAME state — identical on
/// the `briefed_head` axis — so the only thing left that can distinguish them is
/// the VERDICT. A selection rule that read the record would pick lane 0: it is
/// first in the gate's order and its record is exactly as stale as lane 1's. The
/// assertion is that lane **1** opens.
///
/// **Asserting the property rather than the fixture** is what removes the
/// dependence on the resume happening to blank every lane. All four crossings of
/// {record blank, record stale} x {pass current, pass stale} are pinned, so "a
/// lane whose pass stands is never re-opened, whatever its record says" holds
/// however many lanes a future resume decides to clear.
///
/// **`Blank` IS the post-resume state**, which is what makes a `decide`-level
/// pin cover the arc #1841's B4 lives on: clearing `briefed_head` for every lane
/// is exactly the `Rec::Blank` row, and the row says that clearing it changes
/// nothing about WHICH lane is chosen. `Rec::Stale` is the ordinary post-push
/// state, and it is there so the property is not stated only about the resume.
/// The stale-pass column is the control that stops "always answer 1" passing.
///
/// **A third record state is deliberately not a row here.** A record briefed at
/// the LIVE head answers `Wait`, which names no lane and therefore witnesses
/// nothing about selection — it holds identically whichever lane the drive is
/// waiting on. The first draft of this test asserted `OpenLane { index: 1 }` for
/// it and went red on CI; it is now pinned below as its own strictly weaker,
/// explicitly labelled assertion rather than as a crossing that cannot fail.

/// **A superseded pane parks nothing, and a current one still does.**
///
/// The first version of this rule exempted `message_orchestrator` and argued the
/// exception from safety: `held(messaged)` only ever PARKS a drive, and parking
/// hands it to a human. That argument holds and is not the whole question — a
/// superseded pane can call the tool again after every resume, so the exception
/// allowed one pane nobody is talking to any more to park the drive without
/// bound, an orchestrator turn per park, with no remedy short of killing the
/// pane. The rule is now uniform: only a current pane's word moves a drive, and
/// parking moves it.
///
/// **Both halves, because either alone passes under a wrong fix.** Dropping the
/// park for everyone would satisfy the first assertion and break the hold that
/// `held(messaged)` exists to be. The second assertion is the control that
/// refuses it.
///
/// The unbounded-parking property is pinned directly rather than described: the
/// superseded pane messages TWICE across a resume, which under the exception is
/// two parks and two orchestrator turns.

// ── review round 1: rev-final B3 and N1 ─────────────────────────────────────

/// **rev-final B3.** A live idle pane on the session is reused only if it is
/// running the block the hand-back resolved — and the pane that makes this a
/// defect rather than a hypothetical is one the PRE-#1961 driver minted.
///
/// The old `rd_handback` opened a DEFAULT-block pane on a non-default session.
/// Where the two blocks share a CLI — `worker` and `worker-adv` here, both
/// claude — that pane did not die on `Invalid session ID`: it opened fine, went
/// idle, and is still sitting there. Reusing it hands the fix to the wrong
/// persona on the wrong model, with `rd_resume_block` never consulted — #1961's
/// own defect, arriving through the mechanism added to fix #1960. The same pane
/// is reachable with no legacy at all, since
/// `spawn_agent(block:, resume_session:)` is permitted and skips inheritance.
///
/// **The two arms carry different halves, and neither is the other's control.**
/// The wrong-block pane is live, idle and typeable in both; what varies is
/// whether the RIGHT-block pane is typeable too.
///
/// - **Arm 1 (`right_block_typeable == false`)** — the wrong-block pane is the
///   ONLY candidate `idle_pane_on_session` could return, since the right-block
///   pane has no `pty_id`. It is refused anyway and the hand-back opens a pane
///   (`opened == 1`). **This is the arm that carries the red**: the block filter
///   is the only thing standing between the fix and the wrong persona.
/// - **Arm 2 (`right_block_typeable == true`)** — both are candidates and the
///   wrong-block one is NEWER, so `max_by_key(started_ms)` would prefer it; the
///   right-block pane is reused all the same, and nothing is opened. This is
///   what stops "refuse everything" from passing arm 1, and it is the only arm
///   in which the ordering is exercised at all.
///
/// Stated this way because the earlier wording claimed both panes were typeable
/// in both arms and gave recency as the mechanism arm 1 defeats — which is not
/// what arm 1 does, and a maintainer acting on it could delete the conditional
/// that creates the red-carrying arm (rev-final round 2 B1).

/// right alone and both about ONE pane. `rd_reuse_pane` declined the lane's own
/// pane on readiness — the #2089 class, `unconfirmed` — and #2109's duplicate
/// guard then refused a replacement because that same pane was "live … briefed
/// at this head", which is true precisely because a body-only fix cannot move
/// the head. Too unconfirmed to reuse and too live to replace: 38 minutes with
/// no lane open, the same three rows every tick, `lane-stalled` structurally
/// unreachable because its arm exempts the lane that has answered, and a human
/// in the end killing the pane.
///
/// **The fixture reproduces the incident's own state, not a shortcut to it.**
/// The reuse arm only ever considers an IDLE pane, so `rd-reuse-declined`
/// appearing at all proves the pane was idle — this lane therefore reports
/// (which is what stamps `idle_since_ms`) and its last delivery is on record as
/// not having landed, which is the exact pair the audit rows on #2162 show.
/// Both PR-body seams are set, because `review_verdict` digests what `pr_body`
/// answers while the drive digests what `observe_pr` read: left unset the
/// verdict records an EMPTY digest, `body_changed` answers "cannot tell", the
/// stale `fail` reads as CURRENT, and the drive hands the worker back a second
/// time instead of ever reaching the re-brief.
///
/// **The lane reports AFTER the fail routes, and since #2501 that ordering is
/// load-bearing rather than incidental.** A lane already idle when its current
/// `fail` routes is one the driver RELEASES — it has answered about the revision
/// on the PR, so §3.1 item 5's first state is exactly it — and the pane this test
/// is about would be gone before the re-brief, leaving `rd-reuse-declined` empty
/// and the test green about nothing. Moving the report below the arc-5 tick keeps
/// the specimen in the class this test witnesses; both orderings are real,
/// because a reviewer's report and the driver's poll are asynchronous.
///
/// **The negative control is `a_block_that_already_has_a_live_pane_at_this_head_
/// is_refused_a_second_lane`**, which moves the same body under the same head

///
/// **The gone-session arm is the control**, and it is not decoration: without it

// first tick's report and every one of them failed on its own fixture guard —
// which is the guard working, and the reason it is an assertion.

/// A drive whose lane pane is stopped on a provider's refusal holds
/// `provider-limit` on the NEXT TICK — not sixty minutes later on
