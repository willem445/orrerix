// Pure model for the repo's `workflow.yml` — the user-defined agent workflow (#222).
// DOM-free and I/O-free: parse, validate, derive the graph, serialize. The pane
// (workflowview.ts) is a VIEW over this; the FILE is the source of truth (the
// Kestra pattern — a form edit rewrites the YAML, it does not become a second,
// competing copy of it).
//
// Three rules this module exists to keep, each earned from a documented failure of
// some other workflow tool (see the #222 investigation, §1a-v and §4):
//
//  1. `id` is the identity; `name` is display only. n8n keys its graph by the node's
//     DISPLAY NAME, so a rename silently breaks every edge and expression pointing at
//     it. Here an edge/gate names an `id`, ids are immutable once created, and a rename
//     touches nothing else.
//  2. No coordinates, ever. Dify/ComfyUI/Langflow all embed x/y in the semantic file,
//     so nudging a node churns the logic diff. Layout (if the view ever draws any) goes
//     in the `workflow.layout.json` beside it; this file is the workflow.
//  3. Validate BEFORE a run, not during one. Flowise, Langflow and Dify discover a
//     dangling reference at runtime; Dify will happily *publish* a workflow whose node
//     isn't installed. `validateWorkflow` is the whole pre-run pass, and it is pure
//     precisely so it is unit-tested without a DOM (test/workflowmodel.test.ts).
//
// A fourth rule is about how we FAIL: an unknown kind, an unknown CLI, a dangling edge
// — none of them stop the file from opening. They become findings, the block renders as
// a stub, and the human can fix it in the pane. Refusing to open a file you can't fully
// understand is ComfyUI's #1 import-failure class, and it is the one behavior guaranteed
// to leave someone stranded with no way to repair the thing that is broken.
//
// The YAML subset is hand-rolled rather than pulled from npm: the schema is small and
// CLOSED (block mappings, block sequences, flow seqs/maps, block scalars, comments,
// quoted scalars), and the alternative is a dependency in a project that has spent real
// effort keeping its dependency list short. Anything the subset can't read is a parse
// finding on a line number — the raw-text view still opens, so the file is still fixable.

// The one import, and it is TYPE-only: the capability answer is handed in by the
// caller (see `KnobLookup`), never imported, because this module mirrors no
// vendor fact of its own — see `validateWorkflow`'s knob pass.

// The bug #233 was filed against: `serializeWorkflow` is a FULL rewrite, and every form or

// with 60 comment lines produced a 60-comment-line diff. The interim mitigation (#231, rev-15)
// was honest about that trade and warned before it happened; this is the real fix.
//
// The approach: reuse the ORIGINAL TEXT'S OWN LINES wherever the new model says nothing
// changed there, and fall back to the canonical emitters (above) only for the piece that
// actually changed. Correctness rests on one guarantee: a segment of original text is only
// ever reused when the NEW block/section is `deepEqual` to what parsing THAT SAME original
// text produced — so splicing it back in can only ever reproduce what was already there.
// There is no attempt to re-attach a comment to a field that changed underneath it; that is
// deliberately out of scope (see the module comment at the top of this file) — the bar is
// "untouched regions keep their comments and formatting", not full-fidelity diffing.

 *  1. The bail path (null) is NOT comment-preserving. The caller's fallback is
 *     canonical regeneration, which drops the section's interior comments — the
 *     same trade every other form edit in the pane has always made for a section
 *     whose content changed. The bail fires on a shape this scan cannot rewrite
 *     in place: no field line to anchor to, or an `enabled:` value whose text
 *     does not END in `true`/`false`. The rewrite is a suffix match, and the
 *     reachable case — reproduced through parse → toggle → serialize → re-parse,
 *     not reasoned about (#1869 review 7) — is `notfalse` + ON, which rewrites
 *     the line to `nottrue`: the write lands, but the reader refuses `nottrue`
 *     (a bad-value finding), the re-parsed file still has no `enabled` for the
 *     model to read, and the rebuilt inspector renders the checkbox OFF again —
 *     an inert click, with no pane/file divergence at any point. (`nottrue`
 *     itself leaves the model's `enabled` undefined from the start, so the
 *     checkbox renders OFF there too and its ON click is a pure no-op: the
 *     rewritten line is byte-identical to what the file already said.) The bound
 *     is residual 2's, and it is what keeps this
 *     from being a live hazard: the pane already flags such a value as a bad
 *     value and serde refuses the type, so the file was unloadable before the
 *     rewrite — no loadable file can be made wrong. That residual is pinned by a
 *     test (a fixture with an interior comment and an `enabled: yes` line really
 *     does lose the comment), so it cannot silently go false.
 *
 *  2. A file carrying a DUPLICATE `enabled:` key has this rewrite touch only the
 *     FIRST occurrence, while the reader keeps the LAST. The bound: serde refuses
 *     a duplicate field, so such a file is already unloadable — the rewrite
 *     cannot make a loadable file wrong, only an unloadable one differently
 *     spelled. Not pinned: there is no behavior of a loadable file at stake. */

 *
 *  A DUPLICATE is a reason, not a silent no-op, and that mirrors `connectionError`'s "that
 *  edge already exists": the human made a gesture, and a gesture that changes nothing and
 *  says nothing is indistinguishable from one the canvas dropped on the floor — which is the
