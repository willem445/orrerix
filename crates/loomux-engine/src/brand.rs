//! The one place the old product name is still spelled: the `loomux` →
//! `orrerix` **filesystem, environment and protocol** compatibility seam
//! (#1153 phases 3 and 4).
//!
//! Renaming a product is free right up to the point where the name is also an
//! *identity somebody else already holds a copy of* — on their disk, in their
//! shell profile, or in a transcript and a generated config this app itself
//! wrote months ago. Five of those exist, and they are not the same problem:
//!
//! 1. **The app's own data root** (`<platform data dir>/loomux`) — ours, written
//!    only by us, and the one place a one-time move is defensible. The policy,
//!    its hazard and its escape hatch are argued in
//!    `docs/design/rebrand-filesystem.md`; the decision itself is
//!    [`obs::plan_default_root`](crate::obs::plan_default_root), deliberately a
//!    pure function so the policy is one `match` arm to change — its
//!    `(false, true)` arm, `Migrate` → `UseLegacy`, and nothing else. That the
//!    edit really works is pinned by
//!    `obs::tests::the_documented_revert_really_stops_the_migration`, because
//!    the first cut of it did not (see [`obs::RootPlan`](crate::obs::RootPlan)).
//! 2. **A repo's committed config dir** (`.loomux/`) — *the user's*, in *their*
//!    git history, on *their* branches. Never moved, never renamed, not once:
//!    the preferred name is read first and the legacy name is read when the
//!    preferred one is absent, forever, and a repo that keeps `.loomux/`
//!    keeps working with no action and no nag. See [`pick_repo_path`].
//! 3. **Environment variables** — an operator's shell profiles, CI configs and
//!    scripts, which we cannot edit and must not break. `ORRERIX_X` is preferred
//!    and `LOOMUX_X` is the fallback. See [`pick_env`].
//! 4. **Protocol identities** — the notice marker, the MCP server name and
//!    token header, the audit actor: what *agents* match on. Not a file and
//!    not a variable, but the same shape of problem under a stricter rule,
//!    for the reason argued at [`NOTICE_MARKERS`] — one spelling emitted,
//!    every spelling accepted, and the accepted set written down exactly
//!    once (#1153 phase 3).
//!
//! 5. **The Tauri bundle identifier** — the app's identity to the *operating
//!    system*, and the only one of these whose directory is created and
//!    written by somebody else. WebView2 (Windows) and WebKitGTK (Linux) key
//!    their browser profile on `<data_local_dir>/<identifier>`, and macOS keys
//!    the TCC microphone grant on `CFBundleIdentifier`. It moves once, by the
//!    same machinery as (1) — with one deliberate asymmetry argued in
//!    `docs/design/rebrand-bundle.md`: a *refused* rename starts a FRESH
//!    profile instead of falling back to the old directory, because the old
//!    directory is exactly where a still-running old build's WebView2 browser
//!    process already is (#394). The decision is
//!    [`obs::init_webview_profile_from`](crate::obs::init_webview_profile_from).
//!
//! Every decision here is a pure function over "what exists / what is set", so
//! the *policy* is testable without a disk or a mutated process environment
//! (`std::env::set_var` is both `unsafe` and cross-thread global — not something
//! to reach for to test a two-branch rule). The thin readers that supply the
//! real inputs sit beside each pure function and carry no logic of their own.
//!
//! **This module is meant to shrink and eventually die.** Every `LEGACY_`
//! constant below is a deprecation, and deleting one is a deliberate,
//! separately-argued break of somebody's working setup — not tidying.

// transcript*, an *already-generated* CLI config on disk and a *pane already
// briefed* — none of which we can rewrite. So the rule here is stricter than
// dual-discovery: emit exactly one spelling, accept both on every reading
// surface, and never let the two sets be written down twice.

/// The marker every notice this app types into a pane opens with.
///
/// Protocol, not decoration. Three surfaces turn on it: the role templates
/// teach an agent to recognise it, `mask_loomux_notices` (`orchestration`)

/// `text`). Nothing an agent sends *through* this app can carry the marker:
/// `notify::sanitize_gh_text` rewrites `[`→`(` in every untrusted field
/// before it is formatted into a notice, and `intake`'s own test pins that a
/// third-party issue title can never produce this string. But an agent's pane
/// *output* is not sanitized at all, so an agent can print these bytes itself
/// — echoing a notice back, quoting one in a summary, or induced to by a
/// hostile prompt. A marker row is therefore evidence that *someone wrote a
/// notice-shaped row*, never proof that this app wrote this one, and

/// - **Neutralizing it is a security control.** The forgery guard rewrites
///   `[`→`(` in untrusted text precisely so a hostile issue title cannot
///   produce a row an agent reads as a host notice. An agent briefed before
