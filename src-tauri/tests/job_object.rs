//! Windows Job Object kill-on-close integration test (issue #78).
//!
//! Proves the core guarantee W1 adds: enrolling a pane's spawned child in a
//! `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE` job means closing the job handle reaps
//! the *whole* descendant tree — not just the direct child. Pre-#78, killing an
//! ancestor on Windows left descendants (orphaned wrapper shells with live
//! agents, a squatting vite) running.
//!
//! The test opens a real ConPTY the same way `spawn_pty` does, enrolls the
//! pane's shell via the exact code path production uses
//! (`loomux_lib::pty::assign_kill_on_close_job`), and only THEN types a command
//! into the pane that starts a wrapper shell around a long-lived process.
//! Dropping only the job handle must reap both of them and the shell.
//! See docs/design/job-object-teardown.md.
//!
//! ## Why nothing in here starts a PowerShell (#1345)
//!
//! The first cut drove the pane with PowerShell, had that shell spawn a *second*
//! PowerShell as the grandchild, and waited up to 15 s for the grandchild's PID
//! to land in a temp file. Every item that window had to cover was a process
//! start: a cold `pwsh` booting far enough to execute a `-Command` script, an
//! 800 ms sleep so the test could win the enrollment race, and then a second
//! `pwsh` image load. Afterwards the test answered "is this PID alive?" by
//! starting yet another PowerShell per answer (`Get-Process`) — four of them on
//! a healthy run, and one more per 100 ms for as long as either teardown wait
//! went unsatisfied.
//!
//! On `windows-latest` it failed four times in one day, always as "grandchild
//! never reported its PID", always green on re-run, and once on a tree whose
//! exact contents had already passed the same job on `main`. The window was the
//! symptom rather than the defect: every process start inside it was an artifact
//! of how the test was written, not anything #78 guarantees. So they are gone,
//! rather than the window being widened over them:
//!
//! 1. **The tree is native.** `cmd.exe` and `ping.exe` are small, always-resident
//!    System32 binaries; PowerShell is a CLR host that has to boot before it can
//!    run a script, which is what made the old critical path long enough to lose.
//!    Nothing about the guarantee under test cares which program the descendants
//!    run — only that they are descendants born after enrollment.
//! 2. **The ordering is causal, not timed.** The old shell script slept 800 ms so
//!    the test could win the race to enroll it before it forked. Here the
//!    descendants cannot exist until the command that creates them is typed into
//!    the pane, and it is typed after `assign_kill_on_close_job` has returned —
//!    so "born after enrollment" holds by construction and there is no race to
//!    lose. Typing into a pane's shell is also what orrerix does in production.
//! 3. **Liveness and teardown are handle waits.** A `SYNCHRONIZE` handle on a
//!    process is signaled the instant the kernel terminates it, so the teardown
//!    assertion is a real wait (`WaitForSingleObject`) that returns the moment it
//!    happens — no polling, no per-poll process start, and no PID-reuse hazard,
//!    since a handle names one process for as long as it is held. Discovery
//!    still reads the real OS process table (`sysinfo`, which sits on
//!    `NtQuerySystemInformation` — the same table `Get-Process` reports on);
//!    what it no longer does is boot a shell to ask.
//!
//! The budgets below are therefore slack, not schedule: a passing run leaves
//! [`SHELL_SPEAKS`], [`TREE_APPEARS`] and [`TREE_DIES`] almost entirely unspent,
//! because each one ends when the thing it is waiting for happens.
//!
//! Windows-only: the feature is Windows-only (Unix relies on process-group
//! teardown). The whole file compiles to nothing elsewhere.
