 *     toggle there would offer a checkbox whose only outcome is an
 *     internal-error toast. See `LEAD_CLIS`.
 *   - **disabled with a reason** — it applies, but not HERE: one tab owns at
 *     most one orchestration group (`tabs.groupForWorkspace` is singular), and
 *     a lead pane mints one of its own. Shown-and-explained rather than hidden,
