//
// DOM wiring only — every decision it makes lives in `modelcatalog.ts`
// (`pickerSelection`, the merge) where a test can reach it. It was a private
// class inside `launcher.ts`; the workflow pane's block editor needs the same
// control, and the second copy of a control is the second place a fix has to be
// remembered.
//
// A plain `<datalist>` does not work here and that is why this class exists:
// browsers filter a datalist's suggestions by the input's current text, so a
// pre-filled default hides every other option — a "dropdown" that shows one entry
// until you delete what is in the box.
//
// The `custom…` escape is not a nicety either. A dropdown that could only offer
// ids loomux already knew would be a NARROWER field than the free text it
// replaces: Bedrock inference profiles, gateway deployment names and any model
// newer than this build all arrive as ids no curated list or probe carries. The
// picker fails open, exactly like `selectorknobs.ts` does on an id it cannot
// place.
