// Per-pane output/input activity, reduced to the handful of facts the Agents
// tab (#2122) and the pane Notes rows (#2116) need to say what a pane is doing
// (#2122 slice A2). DOM-free and clock-injected — every entry point takes its
// `nowMs` from the caller, so `test/paneactivity.test.ts` drives the whole
// state machine in `node --test` without waiting a second per assertion
// (`framegate.ts` / `liveness.ts` are the precedent).
//
// WHAT THIS IS NOT. It reads no screen, opens no PTY probe and issues no IPC.
// Every input is a signal the pane already receives: the output chunks
// `acceptOutput` is already handed, the human-input mark `markFirstInput`
// already makes, the attention reason `setAttention` is already told, and the
// roster's own idleness reading off the tab-strip poll. Nothing here costs a
// byte that was not already arriving.
//
// THE `atPrompt` LATCH IS THE DESIGN DECISION. The backend's `waiting`
// attention reason already means "parked at a prompt": `attention_tick` /
// `plain_pane_attention` raise it when output has been quiet for
// `ATTENTION_QUIET_MS`, a prompt shape is on the masked tail, and no keystroke
// landed inside `ATTENTION_RECENT_INPUT_MS`. But that reason is ACKED ON FOCUS
// (`Pane.acknowledgeAttention` -> `attn_waiting_ack`), so reading it directly would
// flip a still-parked pane back to "working" the instant the human clicks it —
// the click is not evidence the agent resumed. So a `waiting` sighting LATCHES
// here, and the latch clears only on evidence that is independent of the
// signal that set it:
//
//   1. human input (`noteHumanInput`) — the human typed, so the turn is theirs;
//   2. at least `ACTIVITY_FLOOR_BYTES` of output inside one contiguous BURST —
//      the pane is painting something bigger than an idle repaint. A burst is
//      chunks arriving less than `ACTIVITY_WINDOW_MS` apart: they keep topping
//      up one count, and the first chunk after a longer gap starts over. It is
//      deliberately NOT a fixed window, so a pane repainting steadily at, say,
//      3.9 s intervals does eventually cross the floor — a terminal painting
//      without pause for a minute is not a parked one, and the direction that
//      reading fails in is `working`, never a false turn-done.
//
// Both clears are bounded and signal-independent, which is what
// `.orrerix/lessons.md` requires of any suppression driven by a fallible
// signal: neither depends on the attention scan noticing anything, so the
// latch can never be held on by the scan going quiet.
//
// NO RESET ON RESPAWN, deliberately. `lastHumanInputMs` is a PANE fact, not a
// process one — the same reasoning `humanOrigin` carries in `pane.ts` ("it
// belongs to the PANE, not to one process") — and the latch needs none either:
// a respawned agent CLI repaints far more than the floor on boot, which is
// clear (2) above, and a respawned plain shell that comes back sitting at a
// prompt is correctly still `atPrompt`. Nothing stays latched without the pane
// genuinely being parked.

/** Bytes of output inside one contiguous burst (see `ACTIVITY_WINDOW_MS`) that

 *
 *  DUPLICATED from the backend's `DEFAULT_IDLE_ACTIVITY_FLOOR_BYTES`
 *  (`src-tauri/src/orchestration/mod.rs`), where the number was measured: a
 *  full idle Claude Code input-box repaint is ~164 bytes
 *  (`src-tauri/tests/fixtures/attention/idle-input-box.txt`), so 2048 clears it
 *  by an order of magnitude while still sitting far under any real turn's
 *  output. Duplicated rather than plumbed for the reason `DOCK_TERM_RESERVE_PX`
 *  is, and pinned against the Rust literal by `test/paneactivity.test.ts`,
 *  which reads the Rust source off disk so the two defaults cannot drift silently.
 *
 *  RESIDUAL, stated because the Rust side is NOT a bare const: the backend's
 *  floor is a live-tunable guardrail knob (`Guardrails.idle_activity_floor_bytes`
 *  / `set_idle_activity_floor`), so a group that raises its own floor is running
 *  a value this copy does not read. Nothing here plumbs it — that would be a
 *  wire read per pane per second for a number nobody has yet moved. The
 *  divergence is bounded and it fails in the safe direction: a frontend floor
 *  BELOW the backend's clears the latch earlier, so the pane reads `working`,
 *  which is the ladder's honest "no evidence of a prompt" — never a turn-done
 *  claim that is not true. */

 *
 *  This is a gap bound, not a fixed window: chunks arriving closer together than
