// The panel is ONE human-attention surface over TWO registries, and it owns
// neither of them:
//
//   QUESTIONS — pending `ask_human` rows from `questions.json`, read through
//   the existing `orch_questions_list` command and answered through the
//   existing `orch_question_answer` one. The registry is the record; this is
//   the trusted surface that settles a row (docs/design/human-questions.md).
//
//   NEEDS-YOU ITEMS — first-class rows from `needs-you.json` (#1151 slice A,
//   docs/design/needs-you-items.md), read with `orch_needs_you_list` and closed
//   out with `orch_needs_you_resolve`. An item OWNS who asked, when, what for
//   and open/resolved; everything about the board row it names — title, status,
//   demo path, PR, assignee, whether Proceed applies — is JOINED LIVE from
//   `tasks.json` at render time (`linkTask`) and never snapshotted, because a
//   second record about board state is the drift machine.
//
// **The demo tier used to be a pure projection of `tasks.json`** — every
// demo-gated row became a card, and that card WAS the task. That is the model
// #1151 replaced: it gave a panel entry no identity, no timestamps and no
// close-out, so "I have looked" and "I have decided" were the same gesture. The
// backend's transition hook now keeps one open demo item per parked task, so
// this module joins rather than projects.
//
// Nothing in this module reads or writes anything — it is a projection plus a
// selection state machine, which is exactly the part worth pinning with tests.

// Explicit `.ts`, like `agenticons.ts`/`channel.ts`: this module is imported
// directly by `node --test`, which resolves real files rather than Vite's
// extensionless specifiers.

 *    had changes asked of it.
 *  - `"note"` — a plain board note through `orch_upsert_task`, which has no
 *    status gate at all and still reaches the orchestrator (`notify_board_edit`).
 *    This is what a `prototype` row gets, and it is the plan's own answer (D7:
 *    a comment without findings rides the ordinary board-note path).
 *
 *  **Why a `prototype` row keeps the button at all**, rather than having it
 *  hidden: `prototype` IS the #147 demo gate, so it is precisely the row where
 *  "I looked, and this is not right" has to be sayable. Removing the
 *  affordance would leave the tier half-actionable — Proceed or nothing — which
 *  is the opposite of what the gate is for. And unlike the merge-gate verb, a

 *
 *  Two duplicate-write windows, both opened by the fix that made the dialog
 *  close on SUCCESS rather than before the write — the right trade (keeping the

 *
 *  1. **A second press while the first write is outstanding.** Hitting

 *     calls — two `Requested changes: …` notes on one task and two `[orrerix]`
 *     deliveries for one decision. `inFlight` makes the second press a no-op.
 *  2. **A retry after a PARTIAL failure.** The merge-gate route is a two-call
 *     chain. If `orch_request_changes` lands and the status flip then fails, the
 *     dialog re-enables Send — and a retry that re-ran the whole chain would
 *     record the findings a second time. `findingsLanded` narrows the retry to

 *
 *  The note route is a single call, so it has no partial state to remember and
 *  `findingsLanded` never applies to it.
 *
 *  **`status-only` deliberately re-sends nothing, and that is a trade, not an
 *  oversight.** The findings the backend already holds are the ones from the
 *  press that succeeded; if the human amends the text in the still-open
 *  textarea before retrying, the amendment is DROPPED. The alternative —
 *  re-recording — is the duplicate write this whole guard exists to stop, so
 *  losing the edit is the better failure, but it is silent, and a caller that
 *  wants to surface it should do so at the dialog rather than by widening this
 *  step. The same edge in the other direction: the caller checks for empty text
 *  BEFORE asking for a step, so a retry with the box cleared is a no-op and the
 *  owed status flip never happens.
 *
 *  **Scope: one dialog instance.** `state` is per-dialog, so this closes a
 *  second PRESS, not a second DIALOG. A human who dismisses the dialog while a
 *  write is in flight and reopens it gets fresh state, and a Send there is a
