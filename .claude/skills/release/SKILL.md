# Cutting an orrerix release

Releases are tag-driven: pushing a `v*` tag runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`,
which builds installers for Windows / macOS (arm64 + x64) / Linux, creates the
GitHub release, and then publishes the `orrerix` npm launcher.

**The workflow runs from the tag's commit, not from main.** Any fix to
`release.yml` only takes effect for a tag that points at (or after) the fixed
commit — re-running a failed job re-runs the old workflow. If a fix has to
take effect, the tag itself has to move (see step 5).

## 1. Bump the version — five files, in one PR

The version lives in **five** places that must stay in lockstep:

| File | Field |
| --- | --- |
| `package.json` | `version` |
| `package-lock.json` | `version` (both top-level and `packages[""].version`) |
| `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` | `version` |
| `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` | `[package] version` |
| `Cargo.lock` | the `orrerix` package entry (workspace root — **not** `src-tauri/`) |

**The lockfiles are what get missed** (#90, #224). After editing Cargo.toml,
run `cargo update --workspace` at the **repo root** (the Cargo workspace root)
to regenerate `Cargo.lock` — this is dependency resolution scoped to
the workspace's own members, not a build: it doesn't invoke `rustc`, so it's
the one exception the `ci-validate` skill carves out for agent workers (see
that skill's "The Cargo.lock exception" section). Commit the lock
change and let the bump PR's own CI run (below) prove `cargo check --locked`
is consistent — don't also run `cargo check --locked` locally. After editing
the root `package.json`, run `npm install --package-lock-only` to regenerate
`package-lock.json` — verify the diff touches only the version fields (no
dependency churn) before committing it.

`npm/package.json` also carries the version, but the publish job overwrites it
from the tag (`npm version "${GITHUB_REF_NAME#v}"`) — keep it in lockstep
anyway so the tree reads consistently.

CI has a mechanical backstop for this (#274): the "Check version
consistency" step (`node scripts/check-versions.js`) checks all seven
version fields across these six files (the five above plus
`npm/package.json`) and fails the build if any disagree, so a missed
lockfile bump can't merge silently. Run `npm run check:versions`
locally before opening the bump PR if you want the same check without
waiting on CI.

Commit as `chore(release): bump version to X.Y.Z`, PR to `main`, wait for CI,
and stop — **the human merges** (as always in this repo).

PowerShell note: multi-line PR/issue bodies via `gh` break on inline quoting —
pipe a single-quoted here-string into `--body-file -` instead.

## 2. Tag (human-gated)

After the bump PR is merged, tagging is the human's call — confirm before
pushing a tag, since it publishes immediately:

```sh
git checkout main && git pull
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

**Ask for the release grant once.** The grant the human issues for `vX.Y.Z`
covers that tag's whole pipeline — this tag push, `gh release create|edit
vX.Y.Z`, and the release-notes write in step 4 — for ~90 minutes. It is not
spent by the tag push, so do **not** go back to the human for a second grant
mid-release; if a step is refused, the reason is one of: the window expired
(ask for a fresh grant, saying so), the call names a *different* tag or
release, or a release id orrerix could not resolve (the refusal message says
which). The version-bump PR's merge in step 1 is **not** covered — that is
still the human's merge, as always.

## 3. Watch the workflow

`gh run list --workflow release.yml` then watch the run — `create-release`,
four `build` matrix legs, `promote`, and `publish-npm`, in that dependency
order.

- `create-release` creates the draft release once and hands its id to every
  `build` leg (`releaseId` input) and to `promote`, so no leg ever looks a
  release up or creates one for itself — legs starting near-simultaneously
  otherwise race (**~3%** per upstream tauri-apps/tauri-action#914) into two
  drafts for one tag, and the assets split across them: **5 of 9** public, 4
  stranded on the draft, is what that looks like in practice (#282).
  `create-release` is also idempotent: if a release for the tag already
  exists (e.g. a "Re-run all jobs" after a partial failure), it reuses that
  release's id instead of spawning a second draft.
- `promote` verifies the release's own **asset count** (expects 10) before
  flipping it public, and refuses — leaving the release in draft — on any
  mismatch, not just a shortfall (#1962): **fewer** than expected means a
  missing/failed matrix leg, **more** means a duplicate upload or stray
  asset (#282 class). The comparison lives in
  `scripts/check-release-assets.js`, which the workflow step calls.
  The authoritative counts are the `EXPECTED_ASSETS_STABLE` /
  `EXPECTED_ASSETS_BETA` env values on the `promote` job in
  `.github/workflows/release.yml`; the numbers in this skill defer to
  those — check the workflow's value if they ever disagree.
  If `promote` fails with "Asset count mismatch" in the logs, read the
  direction. FEWER: don't just re-run it — check
  `gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/releases` for a stray duplicate release on the
  same tag first; if it's a genuinely missing/failed matrix leg instead,
  re-run that leg, then re-run `promote`. MORE: find the unexpected asset
  (a duplicate under a variant name, or a stray from a re-run leg), delete
  it from the release, then re-run `promote` — but if the extra asset is a
  legitimately added matrix leg's output, bump `EXPECTED_ASSETS_*` on
  release.yml's promote job instead of deleting it.
- npm auth is **trusted publishing (OIDC)** — no `NPM_TOKEN` secret exists; if
  publish fails with an *auth* error, the fix is in npm's trusted-publisher
  config for the repo, not in secrets.
- **Trusted publishing cannot create a package**, and `orrerix` does not exist on the
  registry yet (`loomux-desktop` was fully unpublished, so nothing is installable under
  either name). The first publish is a human `npm publish` by hand, done *after* the
  next stable bump PR merges so the hand-published version IS that release's version —
  `publish-npm`'s already-published skip then makes that release's automatic publish a
  deliberate no-op, and the release after it is the first real OIDC publish. Until that
  runbook is **carried out** — it is written and merged, at
  `docs/design/rebrand-external.md` section 2, which also carries the ordering and the
  quoted npm prerequisites — expect `publish-npm` to fail on a stable tag (#1153, #1297).
  **Delete this bullet once `npm view orrerix version` resolves**: it asserts a
  transient registry state and goes false the moment the hand-publish happens.
- The publish step installs a **pinned npm version** (see the comment in
  `release.yml`). Do not switch it back to `@latest` casually: npm 12.0.0
  shipped missing its own `sigstore` bundle, and trusted publishing
  auto-enables provenance, so every publish died with `MODULE_NOT_FOUND:
  sigstore` (upstream npm/cli#9722; our un-pin tracker is #186). If publish
  fails with a MODULE_NOT_FOUND inside npm's own tree, suspect the npm
  version before suspecting the repo.
- The **Docs workflow also fires on `v*` tags** and deploys the docs site.
  It deploys to the `github-pages` **environment**, whose deployment policy
  must allow tags matching `v*` — a repo-settings toggle only the human can
  grant (Settings → Environments → github-pages → deployment branches/tags).
  If the Docs deploy is rejected with an environment-protection error, that
  policy is the cause; Pages itself must also be enabled
  (`build_type: workflow`).
- Known flake: `pty::tests::direct_spawn_selection` on macOS (#183) — a
  platform job can fail on it while the others pass. Re-run the failed job
  before diagnosing anything else.

## 4. Release notes

The workflow creates the GitHub release with a generic download blurb. Write
real notes after the assets are up:

- Match the previous release's voice and structure (`gh release view
  vPREV --json body`): H1 `# loomux vX.Y.Z`, a one-line theme, `## ✨
  Highlights` with emoji H3s per feature, reliability/fixes sections as
  warranted, and always the closing *unsigned installers* footer (macOS
  "damaged app" / Windows SmartScreen note — expected, not a regression).
- Scale to the release: hotfixes get "The fix" up top and a short "Also in
  this release".
- **Apply notes to the canonical `release_id` (from `create-release`'s job
  output), never by tag lookup.** Find it in the release run's logs — the
  `create-release` job logs "Created release `<id>` for vX.Y.Z" (or
  "Reusing existing release `<id>`..."), and `promote`'s "Verify asset
  count" step logs the same id again. Apply with:
  ```sh
  gh api -X PATCH repos/OWNER/REPO/releases/RELEASE_ID -F body=@notes.md
  ```
  **Why not `gh release edit vX.Y.Z --notes-file -`:** that resolves the
  release by tag, and a tag can resolve to more than one release (#282).
  Pinning every operation — assets, promotion, *and* notes — to the one true
  `release_id` is what keeps them from drifting onto the wrong one. The
  idempotence guard and the concurrency group make a stray duplicate
  unlikely, but "never by tag" costs nothing and closes the class outright.
  The gate resolves that `release_id` back to its tag before matching your
  release grant, so id-addressed notes are covered by the same grant as the
  tag push — no second authorization, and no need to fall back to the
  tag-named edit this rule exists to avoid (#437).
  - `promote` also warns (non-fatally, right before it flips the release
    public) if the release body is still empty at that point, so a
    notes-less publish is loud in the run log instead of silently going out
    with just the generic download blurb.

## 5. Verify — the release isn't done until all of these pass

- `npm view orrerix version` → X.Y.Z.
- The GitHub release has the full asset set: **10** for a stable tag,
  **9** for a pre-release (no `.msi`) — `-setup.exe` + `.msi`, both
  `.dmg`s, `.AppImage` + `.deb` + `.rpm`, the two `.app.tar.gz` bundles,
  and `Orrerix_X.Y.Z_x64.pdb.zip` — the Windows debug symbols, which a
  crash dump from a released build needs to symbolicate (#1218). The
  authoritative counts are the `EXPECTED_ASSETS_STABLE` /
  `EXPECTED_ASSETS_BETA` env values on the `promote` job in
  `.github/workflows/release.yml`; the numbers in this skill defer to
  those — check the workflow's value if they ever disagree.
- The release run's conclusion is `success` (not just "the assets exist" —
  publish-npm is the last job and can fail after the assets upload).

## If publish-npm fails after the assets are up

Re-running the failed job re-uses the tag's workflow. If the fix needs a
workflow change:

1. PR the `release.yml` fix; human merges.
2. **Move the tag** — this deletes a published tag, so it needs the human's
   explicit go-ahead (permission rules will rightly block it otherwise):
   ```sh
   git push origin :refs/tags/vX.Y.Z
   git tag -f vX.Y.Z origin/main
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```
3. The workflow re-runs from the fixed commit; installers rebuild identically
   and re-attach to the existing release, and hand-written notes survive.

## 6. Beta / RC (pre-release) tags

A tag with a hyphenated suffix — `vX.Y.Z-beta`, `vX.Y.Z-rc1`, anything
`contains(tag, '-')` — is a pre-release. `release.yml` detects this from the
tag string alone (no separate input); every job downstream re-checks the
same `contains(github.ref_name, '-')` condition, so nothing extra needs
setting up beyond pushing the right tag.

What's different from a stable release:

- **No MSI.** WiX rejects a non-numeric pre-release version identifier
  ("optional pre-release identifier in app version must be numeric-only ...
  for msi target"), so the Windows build leg passes `--bundles nsis` to
  `tauri build` for these tags — NSIS only, MSI skipped. The asset count
  `promote` checks for is **9**, not 10 (stable minus the `.msi`; the
  `.pdb.zip` IS still produced — the same cargo build emits it either way).
- **`prerelease: true`** on the GitHub release, set at creation and never
  flipped back.
- **`make_latest: false`** when `promote` publishes it — a beta must never
  become the release GitHub's `latest` API resolves, since the README's
  `install.sh` / `install.ps1` one-liners resolve `latest` and must keep
  landing users on the newest **stable** build.
- **`publish-npm` doesn't run at all** (job-level `if`) — the npm launcher
  (`npx orrerix`) stays pinned to the latest stable version; there's
  no npm-side "prerelease" concept to keep a beta installable-but-not-default,
  so the simplest correct behavior is not publishing it.
- Release notes still apply to the canonical `release_id` exactly as in step
  4 — pre-release doesn't change how or where notes get written, only the
  content (skip mentioning the `.msi` download).

Stable tags (no hyphen) are unaffected by any of the above — same asset
count (10), same npm publish. `promote`'s "Publish the draft release" step
never sends `make_latest` in the same API call as `draft=false`, in either
direction (a `make_latest=true` sent that way can be silently dropped —
see the comment above the `gh api` calls for the evidence and why the
mechanism is inferred, not documented). It flips `draft=false` alone
first, then — once that call has returned 2xx — a second, separate call
sets `make_latest` explicitly for the tag kind: **`true`** for stable,
**`false`** for beta/RC (#341, #543).
