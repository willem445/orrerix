//! A repo's committed config dir: `.orrerix/` preferred, `.loomux/` still read
//! (#1153 phase 4 — `docs/design/rebrand-filesystem.md`).
//!
//! The rule under test is one sentence — **the legacy spelling wins only when
//! it is the only one there, and is never renamed** — but it has to hold at
//! every surface a repo's workflow reaches: whether the file is found at all,
//! what gets parsed out of it, and which path the app then NAMES back to a
//! human or an agent. A resolver that reads the right file while reporting the
//! wrong path sends someone to edit a file that does not exist.
//!
//! An integration test (not inline `#[cfg(test)]`) per repo constraint #4: a
//! unit-test binary linking the full lib misses the comctl32-v6 manifest
//! `build.rs` only embeds for integration-test targets.
