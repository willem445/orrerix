// DOM-free event model for the progress timeline (#608, Slice B): audit
// entries + gh issue/PR activity in, one sorted `TimelineEvent[]` out, plus the
// counters that let the view state its own coverage honestly.
//
// Pure and self-contained by convention — no imports at all, not even a type
// import. Every node:test-covered module here (layout.ts, embedsplit.ts,
// overlaysize.ts, taskboard.ts) is written this way: tsc's build forbids the
// explicit `.ts` extension an intra-src import needs for `node --test` to
// resolve it directly (TS5097, see embedsplit.ts), so a bare specifier would
// work for one runner and not the other. The `*Like` input interfaces below
// therefore MIRROR `AuditEntry` (auditsummary.ts) and `GhActivity`
// (issues.ts) structurally rather than importing them; TypeScript's structural
// typing means the real values pass straight in, and the mirrors are the only
// place a wire-shape change has to be re-checked.
//
// Why the frontend and not Rust: extraction is presentation-shaped, the same
// ≤5000-entry payload already crosses IPC for the audit view, and the repo's
// convention is to keep testable logic in DOM-free TS. See
// docs/design/progress-timeline.md.
//
// The one rule that shapes everything here: **nothing is silently dropped.**
// An entry either becomes a plotted event, becomes an `ops` event (a real
// event in a default-OFF lane), is parked as undatable, or is counted as
// malformed. A chart that looks complete when it isn't is the defect class
// this repo has been burned by (.orrerix/lessons.md, "no silent caps").
