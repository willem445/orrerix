// Pure, DOM-free scheduling policy for a pane's fit tick (#1149). `pane.ts`
// owns the timer and the `ResizeObserver`; this module owns the only question
// that has a wrong answer — HOW LONG to wait before fitting — so it is
// unit-testable under `node --test`, the same split as panefit.ts (which owns
// the other half: whether the fit that eventually runs reaches the PTY).
//
// WHAT WAS WRONG (#1149)
//
// `applyFit` debounced on **16 ms**. A `ResizeObserver` callback is delivered
// once per frame, in the rendering steps — 16.7 ms apart at 60 Hz — and a
// `setTimeout` armed for 16 ms fires from the task queue BEFORE the next
// frame's delivery. So the debounce could never coalesce two consecutive
// frames: a debounce window narrower than the interval between the events it
// debounces is not a debounce, it is a one-frame delay. Every burst of
// geometry change fitted, reflowed and resized the ConPTY once per frame for
// its whole duration.
//
// That is invisible for a one-shot change (equalize, autosize, a split — one
// tick, one fit either way) and ruinous for anything ANIMATED. `#sessions` is
// an in-flow flex item with `transition: width 0.24s` (styles.css), so opening
// or closing the session browser shrinks `#grid-area` on every frame of a
// 240 ms transition: ~15 fits per pane per toggle, each one an xterm buffer
// reflow over the whole scrollback AND a `ResizePseudoConsole` — the call
// CLAUDE.md constraint 1 exists to ration, and the one #430's cursor-desync
// class rides on (docs/design/xterm-resize-reflow.md). With six panes open that
// is ~90 ConPTY resizes for one click, which is what the human felt.
//
// #432 fixed the DRAG shape of this storm by BRACKETING it — `beginResizeHold`
// / `endResizeHold` around a divider drag. That works because a drag has a
// start and an end to hook. A CSS transition has neither, and neither will the
// side-dock autosize (#1150); a mechanism that has to be wired per gesture
// covers only the gestures somebody remembered. This one is in the debounce
// itself, so every consumer of the resize path inherits it whether or not it
// knows the path exists.
//
// THE POLICY. Trailing-edge, with a ceiling:
//
//   - wait `windowMs` after the LAST geometry change, so an unbroken burst of
//     them — at any frame rate down to ~17 fps — collapses into ONE fit at the
//     settled geometry, and
//   - never withhold a fit longer than `maxWaitMs` from the moment the burst
//     began, so a gesture that keeps moving (a window-edge drag, which has no
//     settled geometry for as long as the human holds the mouse) still reflows
//     periodically instead of freezing at a stale size.
//
// The ceiling is the bounded-suppression half required of anything that holds
// an action "while X is true" (performance.md §2 P4): it releases on the
// clock, which does not depend on the burst signal still being right, so no
// pattern of ResizeObserver deliveries can withhold a pane's fit indefinitely.
//
// WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT PROMISE, EXACTLY. The tempting claim — "strictly
// fewer resizes than the 16 ms debounce, on every input" — is FALSE, and the
// boundary is sharp enough to state rather than hedge. It has two conditions
// and needs BOTH:
//
//   - the burst OUTLASTS `maxWaitMs`, so a ceiling fit fires inside it, AND
//   - the ResizeObserver gap is under 16 ms — a display above 62.5 Hz — where
//     the old window happened to be WIDER than the frame interval and so
//     collapsed a burst of any length into a single trailing fit.
//
// Cross both and this schedules more: a 2 s window-edge drag on a 144 Hz
// display is 1 fit today and 5 here. Everywhere else it schedules fewer or the
// same — and in particular for every burst SHORTER than the ceiling, which is
// every animated transition in this app and the whole of #1149, it schedules
// exactly one against the old policy's one-per-frame.
//
// The trade is deliberate, and the thing being given up is worth naming: on a
// high-refresh display today, a gesture with no settled geometry leaves the
// terminal FROZEN at its pre-gesture size for the entire gesture, because the
// old debounce never fired. That is not a property anyone chose — it is the
// same accident that produced 15 fits at 60 Hz, read off the other side of the
// same comparison. The ceiling replaces both accidents with one deliberate
// cadence. `test/resizeburst.test.ts` pins the boundary in BOTH directions
// (62.5 Hz vs 63 Hz, and ceiling-length vs longer) so this stays a measured
// trade rather than a sentence.
//
// The alternative that would make the universal claim true, considered and NOT
// taken: let a ceiling fit reflow xterm but withhold its `resizePty` until the
// burst settles — the `held` state #432 already built for divider drags. That
// caps ConPTY resizes at one per burst on every display. It is not free: it
// puts xterm and the child at DIFFERENT geometries for up to `maxWaitMs` at a
// time, which under conpty's resize quirk is #430's own failure class, and it
// would introduce that divergence on the window-drag path, where no display
// rate has it today. Trading a resize-count regression above 62.5 Hz for a
// correctness-class regression at every rate is a product call, not a
// refactor — so it is written down here rather than taken quietly.

/** How long a pane waits for its geometry to stop moving before it fits.

 *  ~17 fps, which is well past the point where the animation driving it has
 *  stopped looking like an animation. It is also the whole added latency of a
 *  ONE-SHOT layout change (equalize, autosize, a split): those fitted 16 ms

 *  mid-transition would put a fit, and therefore a ConPTY resize, at an
 *  intermediate geometry, which is precisely the repaint this module exists to
 *  remove. "The longest transition" is per-panel, and since #1150 that is not
 *  quite the same as the longest BURST: `.sidedock` re-widths itself when the
 *  room around it changes, so a `#sessions` slide can re-target the dock's own
 *  240 ms ease and the two chain past this ceiling (#1203 — deferred, and
 *  neither this constant nor `test/resizeburst.test.ts` covers that case).
 *  And it must be low enough that a continuous gesture with no settled
 *  geometry (dragging the window's edge) still reflows often enough to look
 *  alive — ~2.5 times a second here, whatever the display does.
 *
 *  "Whatever the display does" is the half that is easy to get wrong, because
 *  the OLD behaviour was not one behaviour: the same drag reflowed ~60 times a
 *  second at 60 Hz and NOT ONCE at 144 Hz, purely from where the frame gap fell
 *  relative to a 16 ms window. This constant is where that accident is replaced
