// Unit tests for orchestration pane-badge / identity derivation (issue #75).
// The bug: every spawned worker's pane badge read "W 1" / every reviewer "REV
// 1" — a per-GROUP ordinal — while the task board and roster showed the unique
// registry id (w-2, rev-5, ...), so a human couldn't cross-reference a pane to
// its board row. The fix derives the badge label from the real minted agent id.
// Run with `npm test`.
