// as an INJECTED function, so every rule below is testable without a browser or a
// Tauri host, and both surfaces that ask the question — the launcher's per-role
// selector and the workflow pane's block editor — get the same answer from the
// same code rather than from two hand-copied merges.
//
// Two sources feed it, and they are different KINDS of claim:
//
//   curated (`orchclis.ts`)  a suggestion list, written down here in the repo.
//                            Stable, offline, and always wrong eventually (#329).
//   probed (`probe_agent_cli`) what the CLI on THIS machine reports about itself.
//                            Current by construction, and specific to the human's
//                            own install — opencode's `models` enumerates the
//                            providers they configured, which no curated list can
//                            know.
//
// So the probe leads and the curated list backs it: a machine's own answer beats
// a suggestion, and a CLI that reports nothing (parse miss, not installed, an
// older build) degrades to the suggestions rather than to an empty dropdown. The
// merge never REPLACES curated entries, because a role's default is drawn from
// them and a default outside the offered list opens the picker on its `custom…`
// branch with a prefilled id — which reads as a human's own typing
// (`orchclis.test.ts` names that failure).
//
// This module states no vendor fact of its own. Which models a CLI can be given
// is the CLI's to report and `orchclis.ts`' to suggest; whether a knob applies to
// the selected model is `selectorknobs.ts`' (narrowed by the backend's `CLI_CAPS`).
// Adding a model table here would be a third copy of the thing #329 says not to
// keep one of.

// `.ts` extension: node's `--test` resolves these specifiers itself (no bundler),
// so a pure module and everything it imports must be reachable as written — the
// same reason `panesetup.ts`/`sessionroute.ts` spell theirs out.

   *  (#1020 — `models-detected`).

   *  The push half of detection. A picker painted while the sweep was still
   *  running has already read "nothing yet" and memoized that lookup, so
   *  without this its dropdown would keep the seed for the life of the app.
   *
   *  Two reports are refused, and each refusal is a repaint somebody does not
   *  owe:
   *
   *  - One that carries NOTHING. It says only that the sweep found nothing for
   *    that CLI, which is what every surface already assumes — and storing it
   *    would overwrite a real answer that arrived first.
   *  - One for a CLI an answer is ALREADY held for. The sweep runs once per app
   *    run and asks each CLI once, so a second answer for the same program is
   *    not a new fact: it is this same answer arriving by the other route, and
   *    the two routes racing is the ordinary case rather than the odd one. The
   *    picker that already painted it must not be rebuilt a second time —
   *    possibly under a caret, since a deferred rebuild fires on blur.
   *
   *  Returns whether anything changed, which is what makes "fired only for a
   *  report that changed something" true of {@link onReport} rather than merely
   *  intended. A design that ever re-sweeps mid-run has to revisit the second
   *  refusal — it is a statement about the producer, not about reports. */
