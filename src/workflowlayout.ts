// The workflow graph's GEOMETRY and its LAYOUT FILE (#222 v2). Pure and DOM-free, so the
// hit-testing and edge-routing maths that an editable canvas lives or dies by are unit-
// tested (test/workflowlayout.test.ts) instead of being validated by dragging things around
// with a mouse and hoping.
//
// THE SEPARATION THIS MODULE EXISTS TO ENFORCE: where a node sits is NOT part of the
// workflow. `workflow.yml` says what the workflow IS — blocks, edges, gates — and
// never where anything is drawn; positions live here, in the `workflow.layout.json` beside it,
// which is gitignorable and which nothing but the canvas ever reads. Dify, ComfyUI and
// Langflow all embed x/y in the semantic file, so nudging a node churns the diff of the
// logic — and a teammate pulling your branch gets a "change" that is you having moved a box
// two pixels. (§4, and the reason the investigation put it in writing.)
//
// The layout file is keyed by BLOCK ID, which is safe precisely because ids are immutable
// (§4 again): a rename cannot orphan a position, and a reorder cannot swap two. A block with
// no id yet — a stub in a broken file — simply has no stored position and is auto-placed;
// there is nothing stable to key it by, and inventing a key would be inventing an identity.

 *
 *  Two properties, and the second is what named workflows needed.
 *
 *  **A sibling** (#1153 phase 4), which was a fix as much as a rename: a repo may declare its
 *  workflow at `.orrerix/workflow.yml` or at the legacy `.loomux/workflow.yml`, and the pane
 *  can also be opened on an explicit path — so a hard-coded layout path would write the canvas
 *  positions for `.loomux/workflow.yml` into `.orrerix/`, i.e. into a directory the repo may
 *  not even have.
 *
 *  **Per FILE, not per directory** (#1689 slice D1). A repo with named workflows keeps
 *  `workflows/a.yml` and `workflows/b.yml` in ONE directory, so a fixed basename made both
 *  canvases write `workflows/workflow.layout.json`: opening `b` restores `a`'s node positions
 *  by block id, and saving `b` overwrites them. Silently, too — a layout is never anyone's
 *  work, so an unreadable or wrong one is recomputed and nothing reports a loss. Deriving the
 *  name from the stem gives every workflow its own sidecar and leaves the default file's
 *  answer exactly what it was: `workflow.yml`'s stem IS `workflow`, so it still resolves to
 *  {@link LAYOUT_BASENAME} and no existing repo's layout file moves.
 *
 *  Only the LAST extension is dropped, so `.yml` and `.yaml` are both handled without
 *  enumerating them and `a.b.yml` keeps its dot (`a.b.layout.json`). A name with no extension
 *  is all stem. A DOTFILE is all stem too (`.workflow` → `.workflow.layout.json`): its leading
 *  dot hides the file rather than naming an extension, and stripping it would give every such
 *  workflow in a directory the same `.layout.json` — the collision again, in the one shape a
