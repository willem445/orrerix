//!
//! Its own integration-test binary rather than more of `orchestration.rs` for
//! two reasons. The mechanical one: that file is a permanent contention point —
//! an end-of-file append there conflicts on its shared trailing tokens rather
//! than on its content (CLAUDE.md's git section), so concurrent slices splice
//! into each other's final assertion. This file adds exactly one line to it (the
//! `sanctioned` row the #464 guard requires) and keeps everything else here.
//! The real one: these tests are one subject — the lifecycle of a single
//! capability class — and belong together for a reader regardless of what the
//! merge queue happens to hold.
//!
//! An integration test (not a unit test) because a test executable linking the
//! full lib needs the common-controls-v6 manifest `build.rs` embeds via
//! `rustc-link-arg-tests` — CLAUDE.md constraint 4.
//!
//! No test here spawns a real agent CLI (constraint 3). Command lines are built
//! and asserted; nothing is executed.

//
// The answer is a NOTICE, never a repair, and that is a decided design point
// rather than a smaller scope — `docs/features/manager.md` already promises the
// human "if you close the manager pane, the group behaves as it always has", so
// closing it is a legitimate act, and no code can tell a deliberate close from
// a crash. Reopening on a guess would contradict a shipped promise. See
// `doc/design/manager.md`, "Why nothing reopens a dead manager".

// `group_summary`'s `manager_declared` is the one fact the panel was missing:
// `roles.manager` counts LIVE managers, and the human's question is the
