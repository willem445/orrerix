# The bundle identity: the binary and the identifier (#1562)

`docs/design/rebrand-external.md` (#1153 phase 5) renamed everything a stranger
types or downloads, and closed with a table of what it deliberately left alone.
Two rows of that table are the two roots this note is about, and both were left
for the same honest reason: each one keys something on a user's machine that the
rename cannot reach into.

| Root | Value before #1562 | What it derives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` `[package] name` | `loomux` | the executable (`…\Orrerix\<name>.exe`, `Orrerix.app/Contents/MacOS/<name>`, `/usr/bin/<name>`), `target/release/<name>.pdb`, WER dump names `<name>.exe.<pid>.dmp`, the `--webview-exe-name=<name>.exe` argument WebView2 passes its browser process, and `cargo … -p <name>` |
| `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` `identifier` | `dev.loomux.app` | the WebView2 / WebKitGTK profile dir `<data_local_dir>/<identifier>`, macOS `CFBundleIdentifier` (and therefore the TCC microphone grant), the NSIS uninstaller's "delete app data" target |

They are independent, and they moved in two slices — slice A the binary, slice B
the identifier. **Both have landed**, and the "Value before #1562" column above
is what each one left behind. This note carries both, because the questions a
reader arrives with — *what is my exe called, what happens when I upgrade, why
is that thing still called loomux* — do not split along that line.

## Why the cargo package, and not `mainBinaryName`

`mainBinaryName` is unset, and the Tauri v2 config schema says what that means:
Tauri "uses the output binary from cargo". So the cargo package name **is** the
executable's name, everywhere, with no second mechanism in the middle.

Setting `mainBinaryName: "orrerix"` instead would have produced one name in some
places and another in others:

- it is a build-time `fs::rename` of the exe (`tauri-cli`'s
  `interface/rust/desktop.rs::rename_app`) that runs in `build()` only — so
  `tauri dev` would still produce `loomux.exe` while a bundled build produced
  `orrerix.exe`;
- it renames the **exe only**, not `loomux.pdb`, so every symbolication recipe
  would become "drop `loomux.pdb` beside `orrerix.exe`";
- and it would have needed the same launcher, CI and docs edits anyway.

"Two names for one binary" is precisely the shape #1294 came from. Renaming the
cargo package leaves one name and no rename step whose scope has to be
remembered.

**What stays `loomux`, and why.** The `[lib] name = "loomux_lib"`, the
`loomux-engine` and `loomux-server` crates, `loomux_shim_sh`/`loomux_shim_cmd`
and every Rust/TS identifier. These are internal Rust identity: no user-visible
artefact carries them, ~20 `loomux_lib::` sites in tests and comments would
churn for nothing, and the binary rename does not touch them. That is a
deliberate scope line, not an unfinished sweep.

## The lockstep guard

The binary name has no single source at build time — it is `[package] name`, and
several files then spell it out by hand. Each of those fails in a different
workflow at a different time, and none of them says "you renamed one thing":

- `ci.yml`'s E2E job launches a path that no longer exists;
- `symbolicate.yml` builds `-p <old>`, a package cargo does not have;
- `release.yml` zips a PDB that is not there;
- `scripts/check-versions.js` stops finding the lockfile entry it reads the
  release version out of.

`test/bundleidentity.test.ts` is the half-rename detector. It reads
`[package] name` and runs two instruments over the surfaces:

- **named sites** — one row per construct that spells the name, so a stale one
  fails with a message naming it;
- **a default-deny shape scan** — every `<token>.exe` / `<token>.pdb` in those
  files must be the binary name or sit on an argued `ALLOW` row. It decides on
  the shape of the token rather than on the name of the binding around it, so a
  rename cannot step over it, and a stale `ALLOW` row is itself asserted.

It is deliberately green in both consistent states (all `loomux`, all
`orrerix`): it polices agreement, not a spelling, which is what let it be
written before the rename and survive it. Its own control runs the same scan
against a name the tree does not use and asserts both instruments report
findings — an absence is what a scan that examined nothing also produces.

The one exemption that is derived rather than typed is the launcher's:
`npm/bin/orrerix.js` is the one file where a literal `loomux.exe` is correct
after the rename, and the scan takes that string from `LEGACY_MAIN_BINARY`
rather than hardcoding it, so the exemption is only ever as wide as what the
launcher actually probes.

## Upgrade behaviour: what the installers do on their own

**NSIS, the field case (beta3 → beta4).** tauri-bundler's `installer.nsi` keys
its uninstall entry on `productName`, which did not move, so a beta4 install
finds beta3's key. That key records `MainBinaryName`, and the next install reads
it back:

```
  ; Remove old main binary if it doesn't match new main binary name
  ReadRegStr $OldMainBinaryName SHCTX "${UNINSTKEY}" "MainBinaryName"
  ${If} $OldMainBinaryName != ""
  ${AndIf} $OldMainBinaryName != "${MAINBINARYNAME}.exe"
    Delete "$INSTDIR\$OldMainBinaryName"
  ${EndIf}

  ; Save current MAINBINARYNAME for future updates
  WriteRegStr SHCTX "${UNINSTKEY}" "MainBinaryName" "${MAINBINARYNAME}.exe"
```

So an in-place upgrade installs `orrerix.exe`, recreates its own shortcuts at
the new target, and deletes `loomux.exe` by itself. **The rename strands nothing
on the normal path, and no code was needed for it.**

**The one path it does not cover** is the old exe still *running*. That `Delete`
has no `/REBOOTOK`, and the bundler's own guard —
`!insertmacro CheckIfAppIsRunning "${MAINBINARYNAME}.exe" "${PRODUCTNAME}"` —
asks about the **new** name only. Install by hand (`setup.exe`, `install.ps1`)
while the previous build is open and the delete silently fails, leaving both
executables in `$INSTDIR`.

**That stranding is permanent.** Read the second statement in the block above:
the `WriteRegStr` that records `MainBinaryName` sits **outside** the `${If}`,
and is not conditioned on the `Delete` having succeeded. So the very install
that failed to remove `loomux.exe` still records `MainBinaryName = orrerix.exe`.
Every later install reads that back, finds `$OldMainBinaryName` equal to
`${MAINBINARYNAME}.exe`, and never runs the `Delete` again — and that `Delete`
is the only thing in `Section Install` that removes pre-existing `$INSTDIR`
content. Once missed, it is missed for good: nothing on this axis will ever
retry it, because the name it would now be looking for is the one already
installed.

It outlives an uninstall, too. The uninstaller deletes
`"$INSTDIR\${MAINBINARYNAME}.exe"` — the *current* name — and then calls
`RMDir "$INSTDIR"` **without `/r`**, so a directory still holding `loomux.exe`
is not empty and is not removed. An uninstall leaves both
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Orrerix\` and the stale exe behind.

The residual is therefore small but **not** self-healing: one un-launched file
(every shortcut points at the new exe, and the launcher probes the current name
first) that stays until the user deletes it. The mitigation is prevention, not
cleanup — quit the old build before a hand-install — and that is what
`docs/getting-started.md` tells the user.

### The NSIS `NSIS_HOOK_PREINSTALL` hook, considered and rejected

`bundle.windows.nsis.installerHooks` can insert
`!insertmacro CheckIfAppIsRunning "loomux.exe" "${PRODUCTNAME}"` before the
bundler's own check, which looks like a three-line fix for the residual above.
It was written, reviewed, and removed. **Do not re-add it** without answering
both of these:

1. **That macro does not refuse — it kills.** In `utils.nsh` at
   `tauri-cli-v2.11.4`, once `FindProcess{,CurrentUser}` matches,
   `CheckIfAppIsRunning` runs

   ```nsis
   ${If} $R0 = 0
       IfSilent kill_${UniqueID} 0
       ${IfThen} $PassiveMode != 1 ${|} MessageBox MB_OKCANCEL $R2 IDOK kill_${UniqueID} IDCANCEL cancel_${UniqueID} ${|}
       kill_${UniqueID}:
         !if "${INSTALLMODE}" == "currentUser"
           nsis_tauri_utils::KillProcessCurrentUser "${executableName}"
         !else
           nsis_tauri_utils::KillProcess "${executableName}"
         !endif
   ```

   (`$R0` is `FindProcess`'s result; `INSTALLMODE` is `currentUser` by default,
   which is ours), where `$R2` is
   `"{{product_name}} is running!$\nClick OK to kill it"`. So a silent or
   passive install terminates the running build with **no prompt at all**, and
   the interactive one offers killing as the OK action. `install.ps1:28` is
   `Start-Process -FilePath $dest -ArgumentList "/S" -Wait` — the silent path —
   so the documented one-line install would have terminated a running build,
   closing every pane and every agent session in it. That is the exact harm the
   launcher's own `refuseIfRunning` exists to prevent, and that one really does
   refuse: it calls `die()`.
2. **It matches by image name, and `loomux.exe` names two products.** It is the
   binary of a beta1–beta3 Orrerix install (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Orrerix\loomux.exe`)
   *and* of a stable Loomux 1.0/1.1 install (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Loomux\loomux.exe`)
   — an install this installer deliberately leaves alone (see the side-by-side
   argument below and in `rebrand-external.md`). Killing it is collateral damage
   on a product this installer will not otherwise touch. The bundler's own check
   is name-based too, but `${MAINBINARYNAME}.exe` names exactly one product;
   `loomux.exe` does not, and that asymmetry is what stops the macro being the
   like-for-like reuse it appears to be.

Weighed against one un-launched file that a user can delete — permanent, as the
section above establishes, but inert and visible only in `$INSTDIR` — neither
cost is worth paying. Killing a running app, possibly a *different product*,
with no prompt, is a far larger harm than a stale file on a path the user
already opened an installer against. A future version that genuinely needs this
wants a guard scoped to `$INSTDIR` (so a side-by-side install is out of reach)
*and* a refusal rather than a kill — which the bundler's macro does not offer,
so it would mean writing the NSIS by hand.

Note for whoever revisits it: **`ci.yml` builds with `--no-bundle`, so NSIS
never runs in CI.** Nothing on a PR compiles a hook file, and a mistake in one
first surfaces during a release build.

**Taskbar pins dangle.** A user-pinned shortcut points at
`…\Orrerix\loomux.exe` and the installer only recreates the shortcuts it made
itself. Unavoidable; it is a release-note line, not a bug to fix.

**MSI (stable releases only — betas ship `--bundles nsis`).** With
`bundle.windows.wix.upgradeCode` unset, `tauri-bundler` derives it as
`Uuid::new_v5(&Uuid::NAMESPACE_DNS, format!("{}.exe.app.x64", &settings.product_name()).as_bytes())`
— off `productName`, so #1153 phase 5 already changed it and the binary rename
does not touch it at all. Consequences: an Orrerix MSI over an Orrerix MSI is a
clean major upgrade and the binary rename strands nothing; an Orrerix MSI over a
**Loomux** MSI installs side by side, exactly as NSIS does.

**Pinning `bundle.windows.wix.upgradeCode` to the Loomux-derived GUID is
deliberately NOT done here.** It would make a stable Orrerix `.msi` remove a
stable Loomux `.msi` install on Windows Installer's own terms, which is the
argument for it — but its only effect is at a stable release, betas cannot
exercise it, and it is the kind of change whose first real test is a user's
machine. It is deferred to the stable-release decision, which is the human's.

## The identifier, and the asymmetry in its migration

The identifier keys exactly one directory this app depends on:
`<data_local_dir>/<identifier>`, holding WebView2's `EBWebView` profile. #1205
did not cover it — that migration moved `dirs::data_dir()/loomux`, the
**roaming** base, and the profile is under `data_local_dir()`. Everything else
orrerix persists is under `obs::data_root()` and already moved.

What a user would miss if it were flipped with no migration: `localStorage` —
the launcher's recent-repos list, the default agent, the custom agent command,
the editor command, git-view divider sizes, side-dock prefs. (Tabs already moved
out into `tabs.json` for exactly this reason.)

So the profile moves once, on #1205's rule — with **one deliberate asymmetry**
that is the whole reason this is not a copy of the data-root migration:

> **A refused rename does not fall back to the legacy directory.** For the data
> root, `UseLegacy` is the safe arm — "all my groups are gone" otherwise. For the
> webview profile it is the unsafe one: pointing the new build's webview at the
> old folder puts it in the **same WebView2 browser process as the still-running
> old build**, which is the #394 hazard the E2E identifier split exists to
> avoid. So the refused arm is "fresh profile", and the cost is a one-time reset
> of those localStorage prefs for a user who launches the new build while the
> old one is still open.

macOS has no Tauri-managed path here at all — WKWebView stores under
`~/Library/WebKit/<CFBundleIdentifier>` — so it takes a documented one-time
prefs reset plus a fresh microphone (TCC) grant on first voice use, rather than
a migration. `docs/troubleshooting.md` and `docs/features/voice-prompts.md` are
where a user meets both.

What the flip leaves behind on Windows, and does not clean up: the old
`<data_local_dir>/dev.loomux.app` stays on disk forever — holding just the
signpost after a successful move, or the whole old profile after a refused one.
Nothing deletes it, and the uninstaller will not either: as the table at the top
of this note records, the NSIS "delete app data" checkbox targets
`$LOCALAPPDATA\${BUNDLEID}`, which after the flip is the *new* identifier. That
is the same "nothing is ever deleted, on any path" rule the data-root migration
ships under, stated here so nobody reads the uninstaller as covering it.

### How it is wired: timing, not a `data_directory`

There is deliberately **no `data_directory` set anywhere**, and the reason is
worth stating because "set the webview's data directory from the plan result" is
the obvious-looking shape and is not the one that works.

Tauri already computes the path this migration is about. In
`tauri::manager::webview`, when a webview is created with no `data_directory`
of its own:

```rust
#[cfg(any(target_os = "linux", target_os = "windows"))]
if pending.webview_attributes.data_directory.is_none() {
  let local_app_data = manager.path().resolve(
    &app_manager.config.identifier,
    crate::path::BaseDirectory::LocalData,
  );
  …
}
```

— and `BaseDirectory::LocalData` is `dirs::data_local_dir()`. So the profile is
`<data_local_dir>/<identifier>` whether we say so or not, and the *only* thing
that decides what is inside it is what is on disk at that path when the webview
is built.

That is why the call site is a line in `run()` rather than a builder argument.
The windows declared in `tauri.conf.json` are created by Tauri's own `setup`,
**before** the `setup` closure this app passes runs (`tauri::app::setup` builds
every `window_config` with `create: true`, then calls the user closure), and
that is all inside `.run(context)`. Moving the directory before that point is
therefore both necessary and sufficient: every arm of the plan ends at
`<data_local_dir>/dev.orrerix.app`, which is the path Tauri resolves anyway.
Setting `data_directory` explicitly would mean giving up the config-declared
window and building it programmatically, to say the same path back to Tauri that
it had already computed — more moving parts, and one more place for the identity
to disagree with itself.

The return value of `init_webview_profile` is therefore a **report of what this
run will use**, not a request. It is `None` on the two paths that touch nothing:
a non-production identifier, and an explicitly-named data root.

### Where the code lives, and why there

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `brand::BUNDLE_ID` / `LEGACY_BUNDLE_ID` | The identifier and its predecessor, in the module whose whole job is being the one place the old name is spelled. |
| `obs::move_once(legacy, new, signpost)` | The mechanism, with no policy in it: one `fs::rename`, a signpost, never re-migrate a signpost-only directory. Extracted from `migrate_default_root`, which is now a thin wrapper over it — so the data-root migration's three tests still pin that path byte for byte. |
| `obs::profile_moves(action)` | The dispatch, and the whole of the asymmetry: only `MoveThenUseNew` moves, and there is no "use the legacy directory" answer at all. |
| `obs::init_webview_profile{,_from,_using}` | The two guards (production identifier, no explicit root) and the call into `move_once`. `_from` takes the base directory and the data-root override as parameters; `_using` additionally takes the move itself, for the reason in the next section. Between them every arm is reachable over a temp dir, on every platform, with no mutated process environment. |
| `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` | The one caller, immediately after `obs::init_data_root()`. It reads the identifier out of `context.config()` rather than assuming it, which is what makes an E2E build's `--config` override inert without this code having to know the override exists. |

The refusal *message* is the caller's rather than `move_once`'s, because
"continuing to use the old location" is true for the data root and false here —
a shared message would have been a lie on one of the two paths.

**Why `move_once` is not simply reused with a different return-value
interpretation:** it is. The difference is entirely in `profile_moves`, which
also settles what `RootPlan`'s documented policy revert means on this path.
Flipping `plan_default_root`'s `(false, true)` arm to `UseLegacy` stops the
data-root migration; here it stops the profile move *without* redirecting the
run at the old directory, because `UseLegacy` is not a mover in this dispatch.

### Why the refusal arm takes the move as a parameter

`fs::rename` does not fail the same way on every platform, and the difference
lands exactly on this design's one interesting arm.

Reaching the refusal at all needs a rename that fails **with the destination
absent** — a destination that exists sends `plan_default_root` down the
"already migrated" arm and no move is attempted. In the field that is a Windows
case: the old build is still running and its `msedgewebview2.exe` holds the
source directory open.

The fixture that looks portable is not. A destination that is an existing
**file** is `ENOTDIR` on unix, so the rename is refused — but on Windows
`fs::rename` **succeeds** and moves the directory over the file. This is
measured rather than reasoned: the first cut of
`a_refused_profile_move_yields_the_new_dir_not_the_legacy_one` used that fixture
and went green on `ubuntu-22.04` and `macos-latest` while `windows-latest`
failed on `the old profile must be left intact` (#1688, CI run 33255271096).
A test that claims to be about a policy, and whose fixture quietly means
something different on one of the three platforms it ships on, is worse than no
test — so the two halves were separated instead:

- `init_webview_profile_using` takes the verdict, so **what the dispatch does
  with a refusal** is checked on every platform, with a call-counter control so
  "a refused move yields the new directory" cannot pass without a move having
  been attempted;
- `move_once`'s **own** refusal is pinned against the real filesystem with the
  one provocation that is refused everywhere — an occupied destination
  directory — asserting it leaves the profile intact and writes no signpost.

The two compose to the end-to-end claim, and neither half rests on a platform
difference nobody wrote down.

### The lockstep guard for the identifier

`test/bundleidentity.test.ts` grew a second half, mirroring the binary one: the
identifier is spelled in four places, in three languages, and they must agree.

The failure it exists for is **silent by construction**. A `tauri.conf.json`
that says `dev.orrerix.app` while `brand::BUNDLE_ID` says something else does
not crash and does not migrate the wrong directory — `init_webview_profile_from`
no-ops for any identifier that is not `BUNDLE_ID`, so the move simply never
happens and every existing user's preferences are reset instead, with nothing
red anywhere. Two more shapes have the same property: an E2E identifier that
converged with the product's would put E2E runs back in the production build's
WebView2 browser process (#394) while `verifyIsolatedBuild` still passed, since
it would be checking against the value it now matches; and a `LEGACY_BUNDLE_ID`
"simplified" to the current one would rename a directory onto itself, reporting
success on every arm. All three are asserted.

The one exemption is derived, not typed: `brand.rs` is where the pre-#1562
identifier is spelled on purpose, and the scan takes that string from
`LEGACY_BUNDLE_ID` itself rather than hardcoding it.

Two things it cannot do, stated rather than left to be discovered. It cannot see
the identifier spelled without its `dev.` prefix, or a profile path named by a
variable rather than a literal — neither exists today. And it cannot check what
Tauri *does* with the value: that the shipped build's WebView2 child really runs
under `dev.orrerix.e2e` is what the `e2e-windows` job proves, by inspecting the
OS process tree, and nothing in the unit suite substitutes for reading it.

## What stays `loomux` on purpose, in both slices

| | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `[lib] name = "loomux_lib"`, `loomux-engine`, `loomux-server` | Internal Rust identity; no user-visible artefact carries them. A separate issue if anyone ever wants the internal axis renamed. |
| `loomux_shim_sh` / `loomux_shim_cmd` and every Rust/TS identifier | Same axis. The shim writes the script under **both** command names for a different reason — a stale global `loomux-desktop` install on PATH — which `rebrand-external.md` covers. |
| `LOOMUX_*` env vars in CI and tests | Documented as no-contract in `rebrand-filesystem.md`. |
| The `loomux-mq` git namespaces | Argued in `rebrand-protocol.md`. |
| Every `LEGACY_*` read path, and `.loomux/` discovery | Accept-every-spelling by design (`rebrand-protocol.md`): dropping an accepted spelling is a silent regression, never a compile error. |
