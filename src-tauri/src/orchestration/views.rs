//! The snapshot publisher for polled reads (#1608, plan #1600 §3 Phase 1).
//!
//! # What this replaces
//!
//! Two loops used to poll the registry directly: the group view's 2 s batch of
//! **ten** `orch_*` commands (`groupview.ts` `load()`), and the tab strip's 4 s
//! sweep of **two per group-bound tab** (`tabbar.ts` `pollStatusOnce()`). Each
//! of those commands acquires registry mutexes, and `lock_safe` was an
//! infallible acquire — no timeout, no try-lock (#1609 added a bounded form;
//! this file uses it per SECTION, below). So one long
//! hold anywhere parked every poller; post-#1595 each parked a *blocking-pool*
//! thread; at 2.5-5/s tokio's default 512 is reached in minutes; and from then
//! on `write_pty` cannot be scheduled and no pane accepts input. #1600 §1.2.
//!
//! #1602/#1604 made that accumulation unreachable by single-flighting the two
//! poll sites — one outstanding call per site, never a queue. What it could not
//! do is make the *view* recover: a call that never settles leaves the panel
//! showing its last payload with no disclosure at all (#1604 review N3). This
//! module is the other half.
//!
//! **The polled reads never needed the live registry; they needed a view of
//! it.** One owned thread computes every payload on a cadence, under the
//! registry locks, and publishes an immutable snapshot into a
//! [`Published`](loomux_engine::published::Published) cell. Every polled read
//! is then a pointer clone: no registry lock, so no possible wait, so a wedged
//! registry yields a **stale panel** — visible, bounded, recoverable (INV-6
//! applied to the registry) — instead of an unbounded queue of parked threads.
//! Exactly one thread parks: this module's.
//!
//! # The two tiers, and why
//!
//! - **Strip tier** (`summary`, `usage`) — computed every tick for every group
//!   the registry knows, PLUS every id a tab strip has named as bound within
//!   [`STRIP_LEASE_MS`]. The second half is not redundant and is not an
//!   optimisation: a tab can be bound to a RESTORED orchestration, which lives
//!   on disk and never enters `groups`, so a strip tier built from the registry
//!   alone drops those tabs' badges entirely (#1625 review round 2). The tab
//!   strip already polled every group-bound tab, so this adds no work; it just
//!   moves it off the poll path.
//! - **View tier** (the other eight) — computed only for a group holding a
//!   *view lease*. [`orch_group_view`](super::orch_group_view) stamps
//!   `lease(group) = now`; the publisher computes the view tier while that
//!   lease is younger than [`VIEW_LEASE_MS`]. Without the lease, opening one
//!   group view would put `merge_queue.json` reads, `workflow.yml` parses and
//!   `git` default-branch spawns on **every** group forever, rather than on the
//!   one view that is open — which is exactly today's rate.
//!
//! A lapsed lease **drops** the group's view tier rather than carrying it
//! forward. Carrying it would let `orch_group_view` answer a reopened panel
//! with ten-minute-old data under a fresh-looking `age_ms`, which is the false
//! freshness this whole slice exists to remove. Dropping it means the first
//! read after a reopen honestly says `view_ready: false`, and the caller
//! re-asks on a short bounded ladder (`src/groupview.ts`).
//!
//! # Freshness is per group, never per snapshot
//!
//! [`GroupView::computed_at`] stamps each group individually, and every
//! `age_ms`/`stale` decision reads *that*, not the snapshot's own publication
//! stamp. The snapshot stamp would be a lie in two ways that both really
//! happen: [`OrchRegistry::publish_group_now`] republishes with **one** group
//! recomputed, and a group added between passes is younger than the map it
//! arrives in. [`strip_view_payload`] reports the **oldest** group's age for
//! the same reason — "nothing in this payload is older than this" is a claim
//! that survives a partial pass; an average or a snapshot stamp is not.
//!
//! # Staleness (INV-6, #1604 review N3)
//!
//! `meta.stale = age_ms > `[`VIEW_STALE_AFTER_MS`] — deliberately the same
//! 5 s as Phase 0's long-hold breadcrumb threshold, so the app has ONE
//! definition of "stuck". It is **entered on the clock and released only on
//! evidence**: nothing clears the badge but the next successful `store`, which
//! is what re-stamps `computed_at`. A timer-released badge would come down
//! while the registry was still wedged, which is the failure mode
//! `.orrerix/lessons.md` names ("release on independent evidence, not elapsed
//! time").
//!
//! `meta.partial` is reserved for Phase 2.1, where a section that hits a
//! `Busy` timeout keeps its previous value and flips it. It is always `false`
//! here, and is in the wire contract now so the frontend's staleness renderer
//! (`src/viewstale.ts`) does not have to change shape when 2.1 lands.
//!
//! # Wire identity
//!
//! Every section is produced by the **same** registry function the command it
//! replaces calls today — `group_summary`, `group_usage_live_within`,
//! `is_paused`, `notify_enabled`, `spawn_expanded`, `autonomy_state_within`,
//! `group_watches`, `workflow_status`, `merge_queue_view`, `lock_state`. The
//! payloads are therefore wire-identical by construction rather than by
//! reimplementation, and `a_published_view_carries_every_payload_the_ten_commands_return`
//! pins it. The ten commands themselves stay: `tasksview.ts` reads summary and
//! workflow status on open, and the MCP tools read their own paths.
//!
//! See `docs/design/polled-views.md` for the wire contract this file implements.
