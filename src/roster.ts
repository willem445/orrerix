// The agent roster a group will run — resolved, and DOM-free so it can be tested
// (#222, the advanced-orchestrator toggle).
//
// Two jobs, both of which used to be scattered:
//
// 1. **The canonical role table.** `OrchRole` and its labels were duplicated in
//    three places (launcher.ts's fixed four-row form table, groupview.ts's chip
//    map — which had gone stale and was missing `planner` entirely, so a planner
//    pane showed a generic "AGENT" chip — and orchbadge.ts's union). The union and
//    the badge text stay in orchbadge.ts (its own pure module, already correct);
//    everything ELSE about a role lives here, and both UIs read it.
//
// 2. **Roster resolution.** Given the toggle, the backend's preview of the repo's
//    workflow file, and the launcher's per-role picks, work out the roster the
//    group would actually run and how to describe it. This is the text the human
//    consents to before the group spawns, so it has to say the same thing the
//    backend will do — including the un-obvious cases: a broken workflow file
//    still launches (on the built-in roster), and turning the toggle on in a repo
//    that declares nothing is a no-op, not an error.
//
// The blocks themselves are RESOLVED BY THE BACKEND (`orch_workflow_preview` runs
// the same load + clamp that `create_group` runs). This module never parses YAML:
// a second parser is a second set of answers, and the only answer that matters is
// the engine's.

 * nothing* rather than as a default.
 *
 * **This exists so there is ONE answer to "which CLI does the launch run", not three.** The
 * setup card's preview has now been wrong twice, both times for the same underlying reason:
 * it derived the CLI from a control, while the launch derives it from the resolved roster.
 * First it read the group-default picker (`agentSel`) while the pane launches on the
 * per-role one; fixing that to read the role select left it wrong again the moment the
 * advanced toggle is on, because `create_group_ex` then REPLACES the form's blocks with the
 * declared file's (`guardrails.blocks = wf.blocks`) and the role select is ignored outright.
 * Each fix was correct for the case it named and produced the next twin, because the
 * mismatch was never in which control — it was in reading a control at all.
 *
 * So the resolution is the roster's, and the roster is already this module's job:
 * {@link resolveRoster} is the frontend's mirror of what the backend will do (this file's
 * header: "it has to say the same thing the backend will do"), and its `blocks` are the
 * form's picks in the builtin/none/invalid cases and the FILE's in the declared one —
 * exactly the substitution `create_group_ex` makes. Reading the orchestrator block out of
 * *that* is the same two steps `register_orchestrator_pane` takes
 * (`workflow::cli_of(block_for(Orchestrator), guardrails.agent_cli)`: the block's own `cli`,
 * else the group default), so a future change to what a launch runs cannot desynchronize the
 * two without also changing the roster box the human is reading directly beneath the badge.
 *
 * `null` for a roster with no orchestrator block. The backend guarantees one — the preview
 * runs the same clamp, which synthesizes it — so this is unreachable today rather than a
 * case with a right answer; it fails closed because the alternative is inventing a CLI for a
