//! The VT renderer: [`HarnessEvent`] in, terminal bytes out
//! (`doc/design/harness-adapters.md` §5).
//!
//! # Why a structured pane still writes to a terminal
//!
//! A structured pane has no PTY, so nothing produces bytes for its `OutputBuf`
//! ring on its own. loomux produces them: this module turns the event stream
//! into VT output, and those bytes go into that ring through the same coalescer
//! that feeds `pty-output` today.
//!
//! That is what keeps `get_output`, termgrid replay, thumbnails,
//! `last_exit_tail` and #888's replay-on-attach working with **no API change**.
//!
//! **This is one of §5.1's two projections, and it is not the one the human
//! looks at.** The visible surface is a DOM renderer fed the events themselves
//! (#2891); the ring is fed from the same log, which is why serving those five
//! consumers costs nothing there. Neither projection is derived from the other.
//!
//! # The one rule this module must not break
//!
//! > **The renderer never rewrites bytes it has already emitted.**
//!
//! Lines are wrapped to the pane's columns at emit time; a later width change
//! re-wraps nothing, and reflow of already-emitted output is xterm's own,
//! exactly as for a PTY pane.
//!
//! CLAUDE.md constraint 1 forbids resizing a PTY for a UI feature because the
//! repaint pollutes scrollback. A structured pane has no PTY to resize, so the
//! constraint cannot be violated the usual way — but a renderer that re-emitted
//! its transcript on a width change would produce **the same damage by a
//! different road**, and a worse one, because grepping for the resize call would
//! not find it. So this module emits forward only: no cursor movement, no
//! erase, and no **bare** carriage return — a `CR` that is not part of a `CRLF`
//! is the one that returns the cursor without advancing.
//!
//! That is true of the bytes loomux authors *and* of the bytes it passes
//! through, which is the harder half: a model's own text, a tool's name and a
//! rendered argument preview all reach the stream, and a JSON string carries
//! `CR` and `ESC` perfectly well. [`Renderer::wrapped`] neutralizes every
//! control character in them, at the one point all three cross — see its doc for
//! why the filter is there and not at the call sites.
//! [`no_output_can_rewrite_the_screen`] is the pin, and it bans that shape
//! specifically; an earlier version banned every `CR`, which forbade the line
//! ending this module is required to emit (see [`NEWLINE`]).
//!
//! # What it deliberately does not do
//!
//! Wrapping counts **characters, not display columns**. A CJK or emoji glyph
//! occupies two cells and is counted as one here, so a line of wide characters
//! wraps late by up to its own width. Correct wrapping needs a Unicode width
//! table, which is a dependency; this is an engine leaf whose dependency budget
//! is `serde_json` and `std` (§8.1). The residual is stated rather than hidden,
//! and it degrades to "a line wraps in a slightly different place", never to
//! corrupted output — the bytes are still a valid stream, and xterm reflows them
//! itself.
