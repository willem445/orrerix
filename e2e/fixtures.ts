// E2E harness (spike, see docs/design/e2e-testing.md): launches the built
// orrerix.exe against an isolated profile and hands back a connected Playwright
// Page talking to its main WebView2 webview over CDP.
//
// Isolation (issue #394 overlap — deliberately generic, not test-only):
// - `ORRERIX_DATA_DIR` points orrerix's own app-data root (orchestration/,
//   logs/, tabs.json, running.lock) at a fresh temp dir per test run, so an
//   E2E run never touches — or collides with — a real install's state.
// - The exe under test must be built with `tauri.e2e.conf.json`'s
//   `identifier` override (`dev.orrerix.e2e`, vs the product's
//   `dev.orrerix.app`). WebView2 keys its user-data folder (and thus its
//   *shared browser process*, see #394) off that identifier, so a
//   differently-identified build can never share a running production
//   instance's WebView2 process.
// Deliberately NOT also setting `WEBVIEW2_USER_DATA_FOLDER` to redirect the
// user-data folder further: it's confirmed to survive elevation
// (MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Feedback#5640: "Folder was created and populated by
// WebView2 in both [elevated and non-elevated] cases", unlike
// `WEBVIEW2_ADDITIONAL_BROWSER_ARGUMENTS`), which would make it a candidate
// for isolating concurrent E2E workers from each other in the future — but it
// would also replace the identifier-derived path this file verifies below,
// destroying the one observable signal that distinguishes an E2E build from
// a stale production one. Not used here for that reason (see docs/design/
// e2e-testing.md's roadmap on parallelization).
//
// None of the above is asserted and trusted blindly: `verifyIsolatedBuild`
// below checks, from the OS process tree (not from the app's own claims),
// that the WebView2 child process our spawn actually produced is really
// running under the E2E identifier before anything drives or tears it down —
// a stale/mismatched build at the default exe path is refused loudly instead
// of silently driven and hard-killed.
//
// Known residual risks (documented rather than fully closed):
// - (untested) WebView2 shares one browser process per user-data folder
//   (#394's own premise). If a previous spec's browser process hasn't
//   finished exiting before the next spec spawns, the new instance can join
//   that still-live process instead of spawning its own child, and
//   `verifyIsolatedBuild` would see no child and refuse. `waitForExit` below
//   (called from teardown) reduces the window by waiting for both the host
//   process and its WebView2 child to actually disappear before returning,
//   but does not eliminate it.
// - `verifyIsolatedBuild` verifies the APP is ours (the spawned pid's own
//   WebView2 child is rooted at the E2E identifier) — it does not
//   additionally cross-check that the CDP endpoint `connectWithRetry` then
//   connects to (`127.0.0.1:${CDP_PORT}`) belongs to that exact verified
//   process. A foreign listener on the same port would still be attached to.
//   In practice this fails safely rather than silently: `page.waitForSelector
//   ("#tab-bar", ...)` gates everything downstream, so a wrong endpoint reads
//   as a confusing selector timeout, not a wrong-app drive, and
//   `browser.close()` on a `connectOverCDP` connection disconnects rather
//   than terminates (never closes someone else's browser). A `/json/version`
//   identity cross-check before handing back the page would close this
//   properly; not implemented here.
