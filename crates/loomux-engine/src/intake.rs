/// - **an empty `last_seen` fires the whole eligible backlog once** — which is

///   full-autonomy has an empty set by construction (below), and so does a
///   fresh process after a restart (same one-refire-then-settle property
///   [`label_deltas`] has).
///
/// **An entry is only ever dropped on evidence, never on absence alone**, and
/// that is the whole reason this takes an [`OpenIssueList`] rather than a
/// slice. Three cases, and only the first two are evidence:
/// - present in the response and no longer eligible → **forget it** (a real
///   transition: held, or now on the board);
/// - absent from a **complete** response → **forget it** (genuinely closed, so
///   a reopen is news again — the posture `pr_check_deltas` takes for a
///   reopened PR);
/// - absent from a **truncated** response → **keep it**. It may simply have
///   fallen past the fetch bound, and forgetting it would re-announce it as
///   newly eligible the moment the window churned back over it. This is the
///   defect the completeness flag exists to prevent; wholesale replacement of
///   `last_seen` had exactly it.
///
/// The third case gives up one property, stated because it is a real loss and
/// not an oversight (#785 rev-266 NB3): an issue that **closes while beyond
/// the fetch bound** keeps its entry, so if it is later reopened *and* is
/// still eligible, it looks unchanged and produces no wake. Reopen-is-news
/// survives only for issues closed inside the window. That is the deliberate
/// side of the trade — a missed wake for a rare reopen-outside-the-window
/// beats a spurious re-announcement on every window churn, which is the
/// failure that actually recurs — and it is why [`MAX_INTAKE_ISSUES`] is
/// sized to make truncation rare rather than routine.
///
/// Two gates sit inside this function rather than at the call site, so the
/// wiring decisions are testable without `gh`:
/// - `full_autonomy == false`: no signal, and `last_seen` is **cleared** — the
///   set means "eligible at the last poll", and under opt-in intake nothing is.
///   Clearing is also what makes a later re-enable a fresh triage trigger
///   instead of a silent one.
/// - `current == None` (the `gh issue list` half of this poll failed):
///   `last_seen` is left **untouched**. Treating a failed fetch as "nothing is
///   eligible any more" would empty the set and re-announce the entire backlog
///   on the next successful poll — a `gh` blip must not read as a triage

/// list`), so this is the intake half's equivalent of
/// `notify::MAX_POLLS_PER_TICK` (8 `gh` calls) and is deliberately set to the
/// same `gh`-call budget rather than the same group count: 4 groups × 2 calls.
///
/// Without it, N autonomous groups falling due on the same scan wake is 2N
/// sequential round-trips inside one tick of the single poll loop — at N =
/// 10–20 that is 20–40 round-trips (~1s each) before the loop can sleep
/// again, and every `notify_when` notice in the process waits behind them.
/// The overflow is not dropped: it is simply still due on the next scan, and
/// the oldest-polled-first ordering below is what makes that a deferral
/// rather than starvation.
pub const MAX_INTAKE_POLLS_PER_TICK: usize = 4;

/// Pick which autonomous groups are due for an intake poll this scan: every
/// group whose `intake_poll_minutes` guardrail is nonzero (0 = the feature is
/// off for that group — no poll, no gate, today's behavior) and whose last
/// poll is at least that many minutes old, oldest-polled first and capped at
/// `MAX_INTAKE_POLLS_PER_TICK`. Pure so the due-selection policy (the GitHub
/// API budget backstop — no more than one `gh` round-trip pair per group per
/// configured interval, and no more than a bounded number of pairs per scan)
/// is testable with no `gh`, no lock, and no registry, exactly like
/// `notify::due_watches`.
///
/// The ordering is load-bearing, not cosmetic (#656): this reads from a
/// `HashMap`, so an uncapped-then-truncated list would cut at an arbitrary
/// point that a fixed hash seed could keep cutting the same way, starving
/// whichever groups landed on the wrong side of it forever. Sorting by
/// `last_poll_ms` makes the group deferred by this scan the oldest — and so
/// the first taken — on the next one. The group name breaks ties so the same
/// due set always yields the same selection: never-polled groups all share
/// `last = 0`, and the round-robin can only be fair if the tiebreak is
/// deterministic rather than the map's iteration order.
