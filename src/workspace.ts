// A Workspace: one project tab's Grid + its own minimize dock, wrapped in a

// Switching tabs shows/hides these containers with `display:none` — inheriting
// the maximize no-resize guarantee: a hidden container's panes report zero width
// and so issue no PTY resize (panefit.ts `shouldResizePty`; CLAUDE.md
// constraint 1). Panes are NEVER detached on hide — detaching would lose
// scrollback beyond the backend's ring — only hidden.
