//! Named lock resources (#858) — the pure state machine.
//!
//! A repo declares scarce things in `.loomux/workflow.yml`:
//!
//! ```yaml
//! resources:
//!   build: { slots: 1, max_hold_minutes: 45 }
//! ```
//!
//! and agents serialize on them with `acquire_lock` / `release_lock` /
//! `list_locks`. What a resource *means* is the repo's business (CLAUDE.md
//! constraint 8): this module knows names, slot counts and clocks, and nothing
//! about compilers, GPUs, ports or devices.
//!
//! **Cooperative, not enforced.** #318's resource guard tried to enforce
//! serialization by shadowing the guarded program on `PATH`; #322 was closed
//! unmerged because a shim only intercepts the shells it shadows — a
//! PowerShell or absolute-path invocation walks straight past it (#335). This
//! mechanism does not pretend otherwise: an agent holds a lock because it
//! asked for one, and the audit log records who held what for how long.
//! Advisory locking that is *honest* about being advisory beats enforcement
//! that is bypassable while claiming not to be.
//!
//! **Nothing here ever blocks.** `acquire_lock` returns immediately — granted,
//! or queued with a position — and a grant that arrives later is delivered as
//! an `[orrerix]` pane notice, exactly like a `notify_when` watch resolving. A
//! blocking acquire would be the #590 deadlock by construction: the notice
//! saying "it's yours" is *typed into the pane*, and a pane blocked mid-call
//! cannot take delivery of the thing it is blocked on.
//!
//! **Every wait and every hold is bounded** (the lessons-file rule: a
//! suppression driven by a fallible signal must be bounded). A hold expires at
//! `max_hold_minutes`; a queued request expires at its own `wait_minutes`; a
//! holder or waiter whose pane is gone is dropped on the next sweep. Every one
//! of those is an audited event, never a silent state change.
//!
//! Design note: `docs/design/lock-resources.md`.
