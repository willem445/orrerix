Orrerix tries to fail *loud and specific* — most problems surface as an inline
message or toast that names the cause. This page collects the recurring ones.

## Voice: whisper failed to run

Almost always **missing DLLs**. `whisper-cli.exe` needs its whole DLL set beside
it — `whisper.dll`, `ggml.dll`, `ggml-base.dll`, and every `ggml-cpu-*.dll`.
`ggml` loads the `ggml-cpu-*.dll` matching your CPU at runtime, so if you copied
just the `.exe`, it dies before transcribing anything.

Orrerix detects this specific failure (the Windows DLL-load error codes) and tells
you to copy the `.dll` files next to `whisper-cli.exe`. Fix:

- Re-extract **all** files from the whisper.cpp `whisper-bin-x64.zip` into the
  same folder as `whisper-cli.exe`, **or**
- just run the staging script, which places a complete, checksum-verified set for
  you:

  ```powershell
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\stage-whisper.ps1
  ```

See [Voice prompts → Set it up](features/voice-prompts.html#set-it-up-windows).

## Voice: no transcript / "you didn't say anything"

- **Mic permission.** If the microphone can't be opened, orrerix reports "couldn't
  open the microphone … check Windows microphone privacy settings." Open
  **Settings → Privacy & security → Microphone** and allow desktop apps to use
  the mic.
- **No input device.** "No microphone / input device found" means Windows sees no
  capture device — check it's plugged in and set as default.
- **Long recording returned nothing.** Set `ORRERIX_VOICE_KEEP_WAV=1` and record
  again; orrerix logs the kept WAV's path, duration, and level. A near-zero level
  is the fingerprint of a silent/starved capture.
- Recordings are **capped at 5 minutes**; past that, orrerix appends a "recording
  capped" note.

## Voice: which model / it's slow

`base.en` is the default. For better accuracy at similar speed, use
`large-v3-turbo` quantized (`q8_0` is the sweet spot). NVIDIA owners can point
`ORRERIX_WHISPER_CLI` at a **cuBLAS/CUDA** whisper build for a large speed-up. Full
tuning knobs are on the [Voice prompts](features/voice-prompts.html#performance--tuning)
page.

## `gh` not found or not authenticated

The [GitHub issues view](features/github-issues.html) and the orchestration PR
workflow both go through the `gh` CLI. If the panel says `gh` is missing or you're
not logged in:

- Install the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/).
- Run `gh auth login` and complete the browser flow.

Orrerix stores no token — it uses whatever `gh auth login` you already have. The
panel shows a one-line hint instead of failing calls, so a broken `gh` never
looks like an orrerix bug.

## An agent CLI isn't found

Agent panes drive the `claude`, `copilot`, `opencode` and `pi` CLIs, and an
orchestration group drives whichever of them its roles name — orrerix doesn't
bundle any of them. The launcher warns inline when a selected role's CLI isn't
installed. Make sure the CLI is on your `PATH` (open a fresh terminal and run
`claude --version` / `copilot --version` / `opencode --version` /
`pi --version`).

An agent pane that dies with an error **stays open** so you can read what
happened — it isn't closed out from under you.

### Codex specifically, on Windows

Codex ships two ways, and they put the binary in different places:

- the **desktop app** installs it at
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\OpenAI\Codex\bin\codex.exe`;
- `npm i -g @openai/codex` leaves a `codex.cmd` shim in `%APPDATA%\npm`.

Either is fine — orrerix resolves an agent program through the Windows command
interpreter, which finds a `.cmd` shim as readily as an `.exe`. What matters is
that whichever one you have is on your `PATH`. If `codex --version` works in
one shell but orrerix says it can't find it, the usual cause is a `PATH` set
per-shell (a PowerShell profile, say) rather than for your user account, so
orrerix's own environment never sees it.

A `PATH` change made after orrerix started does not reach panes that are
already open — restart orrerix once you have fixed it.

## A Copilot agent can't use its orrerix tools

If a Copilot pane lists the `orrerix` MCP server but the agent says it has no
permission to use its tools, check `~/.copilot/permissions-config.json` (or
`%USERPROFILE%\.copilot\permissions-config.json`). orrerix records two grants
there when it spawns a Copilot pane, keyed by the repository's git root:

- your agent's workspace under `allowed_directories`, and
- `{ "kind": "mcp", "serverName": "orrerix", "toolName": null }` under
  `tool_approvals`, which approves every orrerix tool for that repository.

A group created before the rename has `loomux` in its own generated config and
its grant recorded under that name. Both keep working — the server accepts
either identity — so there is nothing to edit by hand.

If the file is missing or the entry isn't there, orrerix couldn't write it —
usually because `~/.copilot` isn't writable, or because `COPILOT_HOME` points
somewhere orrerix can't reach. Copilot will then prompt in-pane for each tool
instead, which an unattended agent has no one to answer.

Note that a Copilot Business or Enterprise administrator can block
allow-all-permissions options outright; orrerix can't override that policy, and
the targeted grants above are what keep such a pane usable at all.

## A group that was running when I updated behaves oddly

Agents are briefed once, at spawn, with the vocabulary of the version that
spawned them. The rename in v1.2 changed strings agents are told to recognise —
most visibly the `[orrerix]` prefix on notices orrerix types into a pane, which
those agents were told to look for as `[loomux]`.

Nothing is lost and nothing needs repairing: recorded sessions, saved tabs,
audit logs and queued deliveries are all still read under either name. But an
agent that was already running may not react to a notice it does not recognise.
**Finish (or end) a running group before updating**, and spawn its replacements
afterwards — a freshly spawned agent gets the current vocabulary even inside an
older group.

## macOS: "app is damaged and can't be opened"

Builds are **unsigned** for now, so macOS quarantines them. Clear the attribute:

```sh
xattr -cr /Applications/Orrerix.app
```

The install script does this for you; if you dragged the app from a `.dmg`
manually, run it yourself.

## Some settings reset once, after updating to 1.2.0-beta7

A handful of preferences live in the app's **browser profile** rather than in
its data folder: the launcher's recent-repos list, the default agent, the custom
agent command, the editor command, and a few pane and panel sizes. Windows and
Linux key that profile on the app's identity, which changed in **1.2.0-beta7**
as the last step of the rename — so the profile has to move, and that version
moves it on first launch. Every later 1.2.0 build is already past it.

**Everything else is untouched.** Groups, task boards, tabs, SSH profiles and
logs live under the data folder below, not in the browser profile.

- **Windows and Linux — automatic, with one exception.** The old folder
  (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\dev.loomux.app` on Windows) is renamed to
  `dev.orrerix.app` in one step and a `MOVED-TO-ORRERIX.txt` is left behind
  saying where it went. Nothing is ever deleted. The exception is **an older
  build still running while the new one starts**: Windows will not rename a
  folder its `msedgewebview2.exe` still has open, so the move is refused, the
  new version starts with a fresh profile, and those preferences come back at
  their defaults. Quitting the old build before installing avoids it. It is not
  retried once the new profile exists — if you want the old settings back, quit
  Orrerix, delete `%LOCALAPPDATA%\dev.orrerix.app`, rename
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\dev.loomux.app` to `dev.orrerix.app`, and start it again.
- **macOS — not moved.** The system stores this profile itself, under
  `~/Library/WebKit/<bundle identifier>`, and it is not a location the app
  manages. Those preferences therefore start fresh once, and macOS asks for
  **microphone permission again** the first time you use voice input, because
  that grant is keyed on the bundle identifier too. The old
  `~/Library/WebKit/dev.loomux.app` is left alone and can be deleted by hand.

## Disk & data locations

Orrerix keeps durable state and logs under your platform data dir
(`%LOCALAPPDATA%\loomux\` on Windows; the equivalent app-data dir elsewhere):

- `orchestration/<group>/` — per-group `state.json`, `audit.jsonl`,
  `agents.json`, and rendered role instructions.
- `logs/` — crash forensics and a rotating breadcrumb log (see below).
- `whisper/` — the opt-in voice runtime and models, if you installed them.

If a group's `audit.jsonl` grows large, note that orrerix **rotates** it (the
prior generation is `audit.1.jsonl`, read alongside the current one in the audit
viewer). Ending a group can optionally remove each agent's worktree to reclaim
disk (branches are always kept).

Durable files (the task board, group state, and friends) are written
**atomically** — a same-directory temp file renamed over the original — so a
failed write (full disk, crash) can never destroy the previous good copy.
Each worker worktree keeps its own build cache (e.g. a multi-GB `target/` in a
Rust repo) — orrerix does not share or dedup build caches across worktrees, and
warns each group's orchestrator once when the workspace drive drops below ~5 GB
free. Details in
[docs/design/durability-and-disk.md](https://github.com/willem445/orrerix/blob/main/docs/design/durability-and-disk.md).

## Crash logs

If orrerix exits uncleanly, the next launch surfaces a toast naming the newest
crash log. Forensics live under `<data dir>/loomux/logs/`:

- `crash-<timestamp>.log` — panic message, thread, and backtrace. The message,
  location and thread are written and flushed *before* the backtrace is taken,
  so a crash that dies collecting the backtrace still leaves a readable record
  with no `backtrace:` section. A `double-panic:` line at the end means a second
  crash hit while the first was being recorded.
- `crash-alloc.log` — written when the process runs out of memory: a request the
  system allocator refused, with the size and alignment it refused. This one is
  **created empty at every launch** and stays empty unless that happens, so an
  empty file is normal and means nothing went wrong.
- `breadcrumbs.log` — a rotating record of lifecycle events (pane/PTY open/close,
  agent spawn/exit, delivery outcomes) with **no prompt content**.

### When there is no crash log at all

Some failures kill the process without any chance to write one — a stack
overflow, an access violation in a native library, an `abort()`. The next launch
records a `crash-log-gap` breadcrumb saying so. When you see one, the record
that *does* exist is Windows':

- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CrashDumps` — a dump, if local dump collection is enabled
  (it is off by default; see Microsoft's [Collecting user-mode
  dumps](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/wer/collecting-user-mode-dumps)).
  Windows names these after the executable, so look for `orrerix.exe.<pid>.dmp`.
  A dump from a build before the executable was renamed is `loomux.exe.<pid>.dmp`
  and is just as useful — attach whichever you find.
- **Event Viewer → Windows Logs → Application**, source `Application Error` —
  always written, and it carries the exception code. `0xc0000409` is what a Rust
  binary's own `abort()` looks like from outside.

Attach these when reporting a bug. Design details:
