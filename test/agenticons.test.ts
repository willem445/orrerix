// The per-agent pane mark (#992).
//
// The feature's whole claim is "tell which CLI a pane is running WITHOUT reading it", and
// three things can quietly break that claim in ways a screenshot would not show:
//
//   * the resolver stops being total — a CLI nobody has heard of renders as nothing, so the
//     pane it most matters for is the one with no mark;
//   * it starts guessing — an unidentified pane wears some brand's glyph, which is worse
//     than no glyph because a reader takes it as an answer (the ORCA regression #992 cites);
//   * the letter fallback stops being a clamp — the program name is a launch command, so an
//     unclamped fallback puts human-typed text straight into `innerHTML` in a webview that
//     can reach the Tauri IPC bridge.
//
// Plus the paperwork: a vendored brand mark is only redistributable while its licence,
// its pin and its notice all say the same thing.
//
// Run `npm test`.
