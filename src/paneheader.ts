// The pane header's overflow policy (#2191, #2335) — DOM-free, so it is unit-testable
// under `node --test` (mirrors overlaysize.ts / layout.ts / resizeburst.ts).
// pane.ts owns every pixel this module reasons about: it measures the header,
// calls `planHeaderFit`, and moves the elements the plan names.
//
// WHY A POLICY MODULE AT ALL. The question "is this header too narrow for its
// icon set?" has three inputs that only ever appear together at runtime (the
// header's box, each control's measured width, which controls are priority) and
// one that is pure state (which rung are we already on?). Answering it inside a
// ResizeObserver callback would make it untestable *and* put a feedback loop one
// typo away — see the invariant below.
//
// THE FEEDBACK-LOOP INVARIANT. `planHeaderFit` prices each rung of its ladder
// from the width that rung's row would NEED. Every one of those quantities is
// deliberately independent of the stage we are currently in:
//   - the title contributes a CONSTANT floor (`TITLE_MIN_W`), never its rendered
//     width, which flexbox shrinks;
//   - `fixedWidth` covers only items that stay in the row either way (the CLI
//     mark, the role badge, the chips, the folder/branch meta items);
//   - a folded control is still LAID OUT (pane.ts's menu is `visibility: hidden`
//     when closed, not `display: none`), so its measured width is the same in
//     both states.
// Folding therefore cannot change the number the next pass reads, and the pass
// after a fold reproduces the same decision. Hysteresis (below) is the second
// line of defence, not the first.
//
// WHY THE MENU IS AN OVERLAY, not a second header row: CLAUDE.md constraint 1.
// A wrapping header would change `.pane-term`'s box, which resizes the PTY and
// repaints the user's scrollback. docs/design/pane-header.md carries the argument.

   *  `pane.ts`'s `measureHeaderFixed` now measures this per child and passes it.

 *  THE PRIORITY ORDER, last thing dropped first. It is the whole policy, and
 *  every rung below is one step down it:
 *    1. the `⋯` button — never dropped once it is in the row, because it is the
 *       only route to everything that folded (#2335: at minimum width the old
 *       ladder ran out and dropped it, leaving a header with no reachable
 *       control at all);
 *    2. the priority controls (minimize / maximize);
 *    3. the pane name's readable floor — truncating a name costs legibility that
 *       degrades gracefully (the rest is in the tooltip, and the full name is in
 *       the menu's rename entry), where folding a control costs a whole extra
 *       gesture. So the cheap thing is spent first;
 *    4. the non-priority controls.
 *
 *  Folding within a rung is ALL-OR-NOTHING over that rung's set, which is what
 *  #2191 asked for and what keeps the menu's contents predictable: a human who
 *  has learned where the git icon lives in the menu finds it in the same place at
 *  every narrow width, instead of it drifting in and out of the row 20px at a
 *  time.
 *
 *  THE TOP TWO RUNGS AND THE BOTTOM TWO PRICE THE CHROME DIFFERENTLY, and that
 *  asymmetry is the whole of `chromeFloorWidth` (see its doc). Folding is how
 *  the row buys the chrome the width it WANTS, so `full` and `folded` read
 *  `fixedWidth`. `squeezed` and `minimal` are what happens after the chrome has
 *  already given way, so they read the width it cannot give up.
 *
 *  A RUNG THAT BUYS NOTHING IS NOT ON THE LADDER. Each candidate is kept only if
 *  it is strictly narrower than the last rung kept above it, so:
 *   - a welcome pane, whose only control is its `✕`, never folds — the `⋯` costs
 *     more than the one button it would replace (`OVERFLOW_BTN_W` is deliberately
 *     wider than `.pane-btn`), at `folded` AND at `minimal`, so both are dropped
 *     and its `✕` stays inline and clickable at every width;
 *   - a header whose controls are all priority skips `folded` (there is nothing
 *     to fold) but still reaches `minimal`, where folding them is what buys the
 *     room;
 *   - `squeezed` is dropped when the name floor is already zero.
 *  This subsumes #2191's single "folding buys nothing" guard rather than
 *  replacing it, and it runs BEFORE the width check, so a header with nothing
 *  worth folding can never be carried into a folded state that would render an
 *  overflow button over an empty menu.
 *
 *  A header with no measurable width (a pane in an inactive project tab measures
 *  0) carries its current stage instead of guessing; guessing "fold" there would
 *  fold every pane in a hidden tab. A stage that is not on this pane's ladder is
 *  not carried — it drops to the widest rung, which is the case above. */
